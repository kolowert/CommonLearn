MVP: balancing ‘value’ and ‘minimums’

‘MVP’ or ‘Minimum Viable Product’ is one of the most overused, yet least understood concepts in tech. Coined in 2001 by Frank Robinson the term has spiraled out of control and lost most of the originally-intended meaning. We are so focused on the ‘minimum’ we forget the ‘viable’ or ‘valuable’ part.
Most technology companies out there today define MVP as ‘the minimum feature set’. The minimum feature set of what, though? To what end?
Frank Robinson clearly defined what he meant by “MVP” and it is very illuminating.
The MVP is the right-sized product for your company and your customer. It is big enough to cause adoption, satisfaction and sales, but not so big as to be bloated and risky.
— Frank Robinson, 2001
Put in a slightly different way, an MVP is a solution to a problem that achieves an improved user outcome across the three areas of great user experience: Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Satisfaction.
In order to minimize risk and maximize ROI, an MVP should also be Lean. Or in other words, the minimal amount of work needed to achieve the desired outcome. Jeff Gothelf and Josh Seidon put it this way in their book “Lean UX”:
Each design is a proposed business solution—a hypothesis. Your goal is to validate the proposed solution as efficiently as possible by using customer feedback. The smallest thing you can build to test each hypothesis is your MVP.
— Jeff Gothelf & Josh Seidon, “Lean UX”
The problem with most companies is that they stop at the “minimal amount of work” part. They just rush to get something anything out there so they can tell the board they’re making good progress. The other problem with many companies is that they’re not focused on the learning part, the “customer feedback”. If we define an MVP as Frank Robinson, Jeff Gothelf, Josh Seidon, and I have then there is no MVP without the learning from customers.
Now, you might say, when you build something & release it (even if it doesn’t solve all 3 areas of UX) you will start getting customer feedback in the form of sales numbers, app store ratings, etc and you can pivot then. That is true. It’s also not lean. Or cost effective. The point of an effective, lean MVP is to get an idea into users hands as quick as you can (before you’ve invested months of effort and expense into any one direction).
Skateboards & Car Frames
One of my favorite summaries of this concept is the car vs. skateboard by Henrik Kniberg (below is an adaptation some of my team members did of the original):

In this hypothetical example, let’s assume for a minute that we’re trying to improve transportation for users currently commuting by foot. Notice in the bottom approach we aren’t just tacking on features until we arrive at what the users really needed, we are focusing on improved outcomes: better transportation. A skateboard is quicker to get from point A to point B than walking. A scooter appeals to more people and is arguably easier to use. A bike is even faster. A motorcycle even faster, and a car is much safer and can take more people. We aren’t focused on the features here, though, we are focused on the Jobs To Be Done. We are getting value into users hands quickly and increasing that value to them over time.
It still takes the same amount of time to get to the car solution, but in the bottom approach we are delivering increased value (and therefore efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction) to our customers.
Another thing to highlight here is that we aren’t fussed that we can’t just take a bike frame and use the same thing for a motorcycle. It is not “throwaway work”. Nothing is throwaway work that helps you learn something from users that drives you to a better product. That is what Agile and pivoting are all about. I still run into WAY too many developers and leaders who get upset whenever “throwaway work” is necessary based on user feedback. Repeat after me: It. Isn’t. Throwaway. Work. If. It’s. Improving. Outcomes. For. Your. Customers.
Maybe we never would have built a motorcycle if it hadn’t been for the learnings that came from the bike. What if we built the motorcycle and realized that’s all our customers needed? That would then prevent us from building a car and wasting time and resources on something our customers didn’t really need! (That’s what my definition of ‘throwaway work’ would be).
MVPs and Jobs To Be Done
On the flipside, though, what if the Job To Be Done we were out to solve was interstate travel? Is a skateboard an MVP in that situation? NO! Absolutely not. Yet this is what I see many companies do. They focus on the ‘mininum’ part and forget the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction.
Why does this happen? I’ve observed that it happens when companies are so focused on measuring success in terms of output that they lose track of outcomes. This is very easy to do in the scrum world. Most development teams are evaluated on completing all committed points, increasing velocity, and accurate estimating. As you go up the chain, the release schedule becomes more important than if you are actually improving your users lives.
Moving fast is important (that is what Lean UX is all about after all), but we can’t forget what we should be moving fast toward: improved efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction for our customers.
Shifting your company to focus on outcomes
So how do we start to shift the focus toward outcomes in an Agile world whose natural tendency is an obsession over output? Find a way to get yourselves, your cross-functional team, and your stakeholders in front of users on a regular basis. It can be remote. It can be guerilla-style. You just have to do it. It may take some ingenious scheming at first. You may even have to do a little guerilla research on your own time with prospects rather than actual users, but if you do it and find an easy way of aggregating results and sharing that learning with the rest of your team, you will start to see a shift.
I have had to use this approach in the past. Yet, I was able to take a team that was completely unwilling to allot time and refused access to users and transform that company into one where our user research was used as a competitive advantage by the sales team to win multimillion dollar deals.
Which brings me to my last point. Don’t think this change will happen over night. It is a process. Use your UX chops on the process just like you would in the UI. Interview your users (team members, stakeholders, business leaders). Understand why THEY feel there’s no time for it, then find a way to SHOW them that this will give them what THEY want. (Quicker releases for example).
People are hard to convince when they think you are trying to convince them to change their priorities. It becomes much easier if you find out what’s important to them and show them how user research will help them achieve what they want.
Another idea that can help is to make a roadmap with success criteria in various stages. What is your “MVP” step for establishing regular user research? How can you get that in place quickly so you can learn and adjust? What do you see as the next step? Thinking about designing process change in an organization in this way really helps minimize frustration and see the incremental results as you go.
Conclusion
We all work in a world where pressure to release something quickly is increasing every day. Yet as we focus our “minimal efforts” and short batches on validating and learning if we have improved effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction for our users, we will not only release products quickly, but we will have confidence that we’re building something people will actually love enough to buy, and if they don’t, we will learn quick enough to pivot and minimize the resources we put into any failed attempts.

Acceptance Criteria: Purposes, Formats, and Best Practices

Success of any project depends on the ability of a development team to meet their client’s needs. The communication between the client and the development team plays a vital role in delivering a solution that fits product and market requirements. The issues arise if customers explain their needs too vaguely and the team can’t understand clear requirements and eventually the business problem behind them. Imagine that you ask your team to enable users to search for a product in an online bookstore by categories. You expect to have a clear interface with category links to click on them (e.g. fantasy, non-fiction, historic, etc.) After two weeks of development, you receive a search bar feature where users must type in the category they interested in, instead of browsing pre-listed categories. While this also works, your initial goal was to expose all available categories and let users explore further.
This is when high-quality software documentation could help avoid the problem. User stories and acceptance criteria (AC) as the main formats of documenting requirements. A user story is a natural language description of a feature. It’s usually accompanied by acceptance criteria.
Acceptance criteria (AC) are the conditions that a software product must meet to be accepted by a user, a customer, or other system. They are unique for each user story and define the feature behavior from the end-user’s perspective. Well-written acceptance criteria help avoid unexpected results in the end of a development stage and ensure that all stakeholders and users are satisfied with what they get.

Acceptance criteria are the lowest-level functional requirements
Acceptance criteria main purposes
Clarifying the stakeholder’s requirements is a high-level goal. To make the purposes of AC clearer, let’s break them down.
Feature scope detalization. AC define the boundaries of user stories. They provide precise details on functionality that help the team understand whether the story is completed and works as expected.
Describing negative scenarios. Yor AC may require the system to recognize unsafe password inputs and prevent a user from proceeding further. Invalid password format is an example of a so-called negative scenario when a user does invalid inputs or behaves unexpectedly. AC define these scenarios and explain how the system must react on them.
Setting communication. Acceptance criteria synchronize the visions of the client and the development team. They ensure that everyone has a common understanding of the requirements: Developers know exactly what kind of behavior the feature must demonstrate, while stakeholders and the client understand what’s expected from the feature.
Streamlining acceptance testing. AC are the basis of the user story acceptance testing. Each acceptance criterion must be independently testable and thus have a clear pass or fail scenarios. They can also be used to verify the story via automated tests.
Feature estimation. Acceptance criteria specify what exactly must be developed by the team. Once the team has precise requirements, they can split user stories into tasks that can be correctly estimated.
Acceptance criteria types and structures
AC can be written in different formats. There are two most common ones, and the third option is to devise your own format:
scenario-oriented (Given/When/Then)
rule-oriented (checklist)
custom formats
As the first and the second formats have very specific structures, we’ll mostly focus on them. However, you may find that other formats fit your product better so we’ll briefly touch on them as well.
Scenario-oriented acceptance criteria
Scenario-oriented format of writing AC is known as the Given/When/Then (GWT) type.
Given some precondition
When I do some action
Then I expect some result
This approach was inherited from behavior-driven development (BDD) and provides a consistent structure that helps testers define when to begin and end testing a particular feature. It also reduces the time spent on writing test cases as the behavior of the system is described upfront.
Each acceptance criteria written in this format has the following statements:
Scenario — the name for the behavior that will be described
Given — the beginning state of the scenario
When — specific action that the user makes
Then — the outcome of the action in “When”
And — used to continue any of three previous statements
When combined these statements cover all actions that a user takes to complete a task and experience the outcome.
Let’s look at some examples.
Example 1
User story: As a user, I want to be able to recover the password to my account, so that I will be able to access my account in case I forgot the password.
Scenario: Forgot password
Given: The user has navigated to the login page
When: The user selected forgot password option
And: Entered a valid email to receive a link for password recovery
Then: The system sent the link to the entered email
Given: The user received the link via the email
When: The user navigated through the link received in the email
Then: The system enables the user to set a new password
Example 2
User story: As a user, I want to be able to request the cash from my account in ATM so that I will be able to receive the money from my account quickly and in different places.
Acceptance criteria 1:
Given: that the account is creditworthy
And: the card is valid
And: the dispenser contains cash
When: the customer requests the cash
Then: ensure the account is debited
And: ensure cash is dispensed
And: ensure the card is returned
Acceptance criteria 2:
Given: that the account is overdrawn
And: the card is valid
When: the customer requests the cash
Then: ensure the rejection message is displayed
And: ensure cash isn’t dispensed
Rule-oriented acceptance criteria format
In some cases, it’s difficult to fit acceptance criteria into the Given/When/Then structure. For instance, GWT would hardly be useful for the following cases:
You’re working with user stories that describe the system level functionality that needs other methods of quality assurance.
The target audience for acceptance criteria doesn’t need precise details of the test scenarios.
GWT scenarios don’t fit to describing design and user experience constraints of a feature. Developers may miss a number of critical details.
You can address these cases with the rule-oriented AC format.
The rule-oriented form entails that there is a set of rules that describe the behavior of a system. Based on these rules, you can draw specific scenarios.
Usually, criteria composed using this form look like a simple bullet list. Let’s have a look at an example.
Example
User story: As a user, I want to use a search field to type a city, name, or street, so that I could find matching hotel options.
Basic search interface acceptance criteria
The search field is placed on the top bar
Search starts once the user clicks “Search”
The field contains a placeholder with a grey-colored text: “Where are you going?”
The placeholder disappears once the user starts typing
Search is performed if a user types in a city, hotel name, street, or all combined
Search is in English, French, German, and Ukrainian
The user can’t type more than 200 symbols
The search doesn’t support special symbols (characters). If the user has typed a special symbol, show the warning message: “Search input cannot contain special symbols.”
Other formats
Most user stories can be covered with two formats mentioned above. However, you can invent your own acceptance criteria given they serve their purposes, are written clearly in plain English, and can’t be misinterpreted. Some teams even use plain text.
Sometimes, your criteria may be specified as an example of system behavior:

A simple set of AC for strong passwords by Mark Levison for agilepainpainrelief.com
This approach provides clear guidelines to password feature testing.

Roles responsible and how acceptance criteria are created
Some of the criteria are defined and written by the product owner when he or she creates the product backlog. And the others can be further specified by the team during user stories discussions after sprint planning. There are no strict recommendations to choosing the person responsible for writing the criteria. The client can document them if he or she has ample technical and product documentation knowledge. In this case, the client negotiates the criteria with the team to avoid mutual misunderstandings. Otherwise the criteria are created by a product owner, business analyst, requirements analyst, or a project manager.

The process starts with user story prioritization and ends with negotiating details with the whole team
Main challenges and best practices of writing acceptance criteria
Acceptance criteria look as if they are very easy to write. Despite their simplistic formats, the writing poses a challenge for many teams. Let’s have a deeper look at the best practices that help avoid common mistakes.
Document criteria before development. Acceptance criteria have to be documented before the actual development starts. This way, the team will likely capture all customer needs in advance. In the beginning, it’s enough to set the criteria for a small number of user stories to fill the backlogs for two sprints (if you practice Scrum or a similar method). They must be agreed by both parties. Then the documented acceptance criteria are used by developers to plan the technical process.
Don’t make AC too narrow. Acceptance criteria can be way too specific living little to no maneuver options for developers. To avoid this, remember that AC must convey the intent but not a final solution. Moreover, narrow AC may be bereft of multiple user behaviors that aren’t covered.
Keep your criteria achievable. This point closely intersects with the previous one. Effective acceptance criteria define the reasonable minimum chunk of functionality that you’re able to deliver. But in case you succumb to describing all little details, there’s a risk that your team will get stuck with hundreds of small tasks.
Keep AC measurable and not too broad. Broad acceptance criteria make a user story vague. Effective acceptance criteria must outline the scope of work so that the developers can plan and estimate their effort properly.
Avoid technical details. As we mentioned, acceptance criteria must be written in plain English. This will make them clear and easy to understand for everyone: Your stakeholders or managers may not have technical background.
Reach consensus. The same problem may can be solved differently by a team and stakeholders, depending on their vantage points. Make sure that you’ve communicated your AC to stakeholders and reached a mutual agreement. The same applies to team members. Everyone must review the AC and confirm they understand and agree with each line.
Write testable AC. This will allow testers to verify that all requirements were met. Otherwise, developers won’t understand if the user story is completed.
Final word
Don’t neglect the acceptance criteria as they — being simple and approachable — solve multiple problems at once. They document customer expectations, provide an end-user perspective, clarify requirements and prevent ambiguity, and eventually help quality assurance verify if the development goals were met. Regardless of whether you use Agile methods or not, make sure to choose the best format or experiment with your own ones. Different types of user stories and eventually features may require different fromats and testing the new ones that work for you is a good practice.


How — and When — to Use Gamification in Your UX
Nov 2, 2018 · 9 min read

Although the games of today bear little resemblance to their ancient predecessors, human beings have played games for millennia. The oldest game known to man, Senet, originated in ancient Egypt around 3500 BCE, and other games such as Go, a strategy game invented in China around 2,500 years ago, are still played to this day.

The electronic video games that began to emerge in the late 1970s and early 1980s borrowed many principles from the earliest board games, but they also introduced many new concepts. Today, we don’t merely “play” games; we’re gamers. Unlike our ancestors, gaming is no longer an isolated activity between small groups but a global phenomena that has spawned entire industries, such as the growing eSports market.
One of the main reasons for the explosion in the popularity of video games and gaming in contemporary culture is how cleverly many games make use of compelling emotional triggers to keep players engaged. In other words, they can be incredibly addictive. While this aspect of video gaming has troubled concerned parents for years, it has also created new opportunities for marketers and product designers. Today, many apps and products beyond the sphere of video games leverage these addictive qualities to keep us glued to our screens.
For UX practitioners, gamification — the practice of incorporating features commonly found in video games into products and apps to increase engagement — is an immensely powerful tool. However, if implemented poorly, it can frustrate our users, distract from the core features of our products, and even encourage potentially harmful addictive behaviors.
Let’s talk about how to get gamification right and when to use it.
A (Very) Brief History of Gamification in Action
One of the core elements of gamification is the creation of reward systems that encourage users to take specific actions on a regular basis. For non-gaming products, this often involves identifying behavioral triggers that encourage users to take action, then rewarding them for doing so in the form of point systems, badges, and the chance to unlock premium features.
Although gamification is often framed in the context of digital apps and entertainment products, many companies have been leveraging these principles in the real world for years. McDonald’s annual Monopoly promotion, store loyalty cards, and even the concept of frequent flier miles all use similar principles to encourage consumer loyalty and ensure repeat business.
Starbucks has been using a gamified loyalty program for years that began offline before moving online. Like thousands of other coffee retailers, Starbucks has offered a loyalty stamp program for many years. Customers received a stamp on their loyalty card with every purchase and, after accumulating a sufficient number of stamps, could redeem them for “free” beverages and snacks.
What’s fascinating about Starbucks’ reward program in particular is how well the company adapted the offline program for its mobile app:

In terms of the loyalty program itself, very little has changed. However, Starbucks has masterfully incorporated elements of UX design to make the program, its app, and its products significantly more compelling. By using the Starbucks app, users can track their rewards more accurately, allowing them to plan future purchases around the loyalty program — significantly increasing the likelihood that app users will visit a Starbucks store to take advantage of their points.
Even the visual nature of how a user’s current rewards level is presented makes the overall experience more compelling; users can see the coffee cup gradually fill with stars — offering a similarly satisfying and intuitive visual cue as a progress bar — and see how far they are from the next reward tier:

As UX practitioners, it’s our job to design rewarding, satisfying experiences for our users that keep them engaged and ultimately coming back for more. To do this, we need to:
Offer users a range of fun and interesting goals to work toward.
Implement a simple, easily understood rewards system that makes sense to the user and feels realistically attainable.
Provide occasional bonus rewards to serve as reminders about the potential value of the rewards program and reinforce the value of our brands and products.
When Gamification Goes Wrong
Aside from strong, intuitive design, gamification is one of the most diverse and effective tools at our disposal as UX practitioners. That said, getting gamification right is a delicate balancing act; make a challenge too easy and we risk boring our users (bad), and if we make gamified tasks too hard, we risk frustrating our users (worse).
Another risk of gamification is the natural tendency to focus too much on the game elements of our products to the detriment of addressing and solving the needs of our users. This can result in an experience in which the gamification elements — the points, the leaderboards, the badges — overshadow the rest of the experience of using our products. In addition to drawing unwanted attention to design elements that should go largely undetected, this also results in an experience that feels cheap.
Put another way, poorly implemented gamification can create visual noise and distract users from the genuine value our products offer.
One of the best ways to avoid this scenario is to focus on how gamification can support your users as they move through your product, rather than merely providing them with unnecessary distractions for the sake of entertainment.
How can we do this? By bearing in mind a principle used by professional game designers known as cognitive flow and how it relates to our broader UX:

It’s important to remember that we’re UX designers, not game designers. Gamification can make our apps and products a lot stickier, but it can also introduce a lot more potential problems.
High Scores: Gamification Done Right
One of the best ways to approach gamification as a UX practitioner is to really understand what makes our users tick and their motivations for using our products. Once we know exactly what drives our users and the problems they’re trying to solve, we can use the principles of gamification to deliver a rewarding and entertaining experience to our users.
Here are four real-world examples of apps and products that got gamification right by taking the time to understand their users and what really motivates them to take action — and what keeps them coming back.
FitBit
As well as being the dominant player in the fitness tracking space, Fitbit was also one of the first companies to really nail gamification as a motivational tool.

Fitbit understands that for many of its users fitness itself isn’t the end goal. Many Fitbit users track their stats in order to make tangible gains in terms of their stamina, endurance, and competitiveness. It’s this understanding that makes Fitbit’s gamified rewards system so compelling; it leverages the intrinsic motivations of the user and offers an addictive reward for doing what they want to do.
In addition to its fun badge system, Fitbit’s leaderboard system is a powerful motivator. Being able to compete with friends and challenge one another to beat personal bests align perfectly with how — and why — many people track their fitness using Fitbit, putting it at the top of our UX gamification scoreboard.
Todoist
Few things are as inherently satisfying as checking off the very last item on a to-do list, and it’s this principle that makes productivity app Todoist’s gamified elements all the more compelling.
Gamification in Todoist is simple. Users are awarded “karma points” for every task on their to-do lists they successfully complete. Conversely, if users fail to complete time-sensitive tasks, they are “penalized” with negative karma. It’s a similar system used by popular websites including Reddit, and it’s remarkably effective.

What’s really clever about Todoist’s karma system, however, is that accruing karma points actually unlocks new tiered levels, ranging from “Beginner” to “Advanced.” This reinforces the sense of accomplishment that users crave and gives them bragging rights for how productive they’ve been — which users can then share via social media for an even more satisfying dopamine hit.
Wish
Flash sales are tough enough to get right from a UX perspective to begin with, which makes discount shopping app Wish’s gamification strategy all the more impressive.
The first step in Wish’s gamified user flow is a Wheel of Fortune-style interface that users spin using a swipe gesture. The wheel’s spinning animation helps create and build anticipation, but it also determines how long users have to shop for bargains. Unlucky spins of the wheel mean less time to shop, but discounts are applied to every item a user places in their shopping cart during their discount window.

Of all our gamification examples, this is easily the most “game-like.” Spinning the wheel creates excitement — just like spinning a roulette wheel in a casino — and the resulting discount window is a race against time, another mini-challenge in itself.
Although the game elements of Wish are front-and-center in the app’s design, it never feels boring or frustrating by being too easy or difficult, instead settling on that sweet spot right in the central cognitive flow we identified earlier.
Calm
Mindfulness and meditation apps have been all the rage for some time, but few manage to incorporate gamification as effectively as Calm.
Calm’s purpose is to gently remind (presumably stressed-out) users to take a few moments out of their busy day to either meditate or sit in quiet contemplation. Because most newcomers to mindfulness techniques are trying to form positive new habits in their daily lifestyle, Calm utilizes a winning-streak system that rewards frequent logins.

For every meditation session users complete, they’re rewarded with a star and a positive message. Completing guided meditations on a regular basis creates “streaks” that are featured prominently in the app’s interface.
This is clever in two ways:
It leverages gamification to help users create new habits, which is the goal of many Calm users who want to incorporate meditation and mindfulness into their daily routine.
It makes it harder to ignore the app’s reminders to meditate by reminding users of the streak, which can be a powerful motivator for not skipping a day.
Design for Users, Not Players
Gamification is becoming an increasingly commonplace technique in product design. However, it’s a lot harder to get right than it may appear, and introducing gamification elements can create complexity and the possibility of overlooking what really matters — our users and the problems they’re trying to solve.
As we mentioned earlier, truly understanding your users’ motivations is crucial to successfully leveraging gamification in our UX and our products. If you’re considering gamification for your next project, it’s vital to keep the user experience in mind at all times:
How do you want users to use your product?
What problems are your users trying to solve, and how can gamification help them do so?
How are you segmenting your user base to identify how different types of users utilize your product?
What elements can you A/B test to determine the right approach that will appeal to the most users?
Remember — we have to do what’s best for our users. This means resisting the temptation to incorporate gamification elements for their own sake or because another product in your vertical included them. Above all else, keep an open mind, be willing to experiment, and, most importantly, really listen to your users.

Transcript 
Note: This is not a word-for-word transcript     

Neil
Hello. This is 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

Georgina
And I'm Georgina.

Neil
Today we’re focussing on the topic of mental health at work.

Georgina
Yes, it’s an issue that can be difficult to see. If someone has an injury, like a broken leg or a serious medical issue, it’s obvious, and we can understand what’s happening. With mental health issues, though, there’s no physical sign and people who are experiencing difficulties maybe don’t get the same understanding as people who have medical problems.

Neil
It’s a topic that has been getting more publicity recently, particularly as members of the British royal family have been talking about it. Also, awareness is raised through events such as World Mental Health Day. And that is the topic of today’s quiz. World Mental Health Day is held every year on October 10th. It aims to raise awareness of mental health issues and their effects on people’s lives. In what year was it first held? Was it...

A: 1992
B: 2002
C: 2012

What do you think, Georgina?

Georgina
I don’t know – I think it will be older than 2012, but as old as 1992? I don’t know. I’m going to go with 2002

Neil
OK. I’ll have the answer later in the programme and we’ll see if you’re right. Mental health problems are very difficult personally for those who suffer from them, and they also have an impact on businesses. Paul Farmer is head of the mental health awareness charity Mind. He spoke on the BBC World Service Business Daily programme about this. How much does he says it costs businesses in the UK?

Paul Farmer, CEO Mind 
We know that the cost of failing to address mental health in business is colossal. In the UK, it costs between 33 and 42 billion pounds a year, about $50 billion dollars, and round about 300,000 people fall out of work every year as a result of poor mental health. So that’s a huge cost to workplaces and to individuals. Behind those numbers, though, are the lives of talented, able, contributors who often just slide away from the workplace because they don’t get the right help and support for their mental health.

Neil
What figures did Paul Farmer give there?

Georgina
He gave the figure of about between 33 and £42 billion – which is about $50 billion dollars.

Neil
That’s a lot of money!

Georgina
It is – in fact he called it colossal. This adjective means huge – really, really big. This is the cost to business he says of failing to address the mental health issue.

Neil
Failing to address means ignoring or not dealing with the problems. It leads to staff leaving work, and he says these people are contributors, they give something to the business in terms of their skill and experience.

Georgina
And because of mental health issues, which could be addressed but aren’t, those contributors are being lost to the business. So it costs companies more money to recruit and train new staff, and you can’t always replace the experience that is lost.

Neil
Let’s listen again.

In recent years it seems as if there has been more understanding of mental health issues, not just in the workplace but in society as a whole. Geoff McDonald is a campaigner for the organisation Minds at Work. He also spoke on the Business Daily programme about one way that things were getting a little better.

Geoff McDonald, Minds at Work 
I think what’s really changed is people telling their stories, and the more stories that we tell it kind of begins to normalise this. Every single story that we tell is like sending a lifeboat out into the ocean and the millions and millions of people who are suffering in silence, do you know what they do? They cling on to that lifeboat and they realise they’re not alone and they might just be normal.

Neil
So, because more people are talking about this issue, it begins to normalise it. This means it becomes ‘normal’. It’s not unusual, strange or hidden.

Georgina
There are people who suffer in silence – they keep to themselves and hide their problems from others, but because there is more publicity about this topic, they can begin to feel that they are not alone and they don’t have to suffer in silence.

Neil
People sharing their stories are like lifeboats for those who do suffer in silence. In this metaphor they can cling onto the lifeboats.

Right, we’re going to another look at today’s vocabulary, but first let’s have the answer to today’s quiz. When was the first World Mental Health Day? Was it...

A: 1992
B: 2002
C: 2012

Georgina, what did you say?

Georgina
I thought 2002.

Neil
It was actually earlier - 1992. Now, a review of our vocabulary.

Georgina
Failing to address is a phrase that means ignoring a problem or not trying to help with a problem.

Neil
Something colossal is very, very big.

Georgina
A contributor is someone who has something to give, who is a positive benefit to, in this case, a business.

Neil
Then we have the verb to normalise, meaning to make something normal.

Georgina
Someone who suffers in silence, doesn’t talk about their problems and may hide them from others.

Neil
And finally, if you cling on to something, you hold on to it tightly, you don’t want to let it go. And that’s all from us from this programme. We look forward to your company again soon. In the meantime find us online, on social media and on the BBC Learning English app.

Sam
Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I'm Sam. 

Neil
And I'm Neil. 

Sam
Do you like sad music, Neil? 

Neil
Well, when I was younger and if I had a break-up with a girlfriend I would listen to sad songs, songs which reflected my mood. 

Sam
And do you still listen to those songs now? 

Neil
Not so much, but I do still like them. 

Sam
Well, it seems as if there might be a biological reason why some of us do like sad songs. We’ll look at this topic a little more after this week’s quiz question, which is about music videos. The music video has been around for a while, but in what year was MTV, the first dedicated music video channel, launched in the US? Was it… 

Neil
Well… 

Sam
What do you think, Neil? 

Neil
I’m going to guess. Is it the early 1980s? 

Sam
Well, yes. Care to be more specific? 

Neil
Well… Well, it was a long time ago – I was just a small boy. I'm going to go for 1982. 

Sam
OK, I’ll have answer later in the programme. But first, more about sad songs. Professor David Huron from Ohio State University has conducted research in this area and he discussed it recently on a BBC World Service radio programme - The Why Factor. He was looking at why some people like sad music and other people really don’t like it all, as he says they just can’t stand it. He believes it’s to do with a hormone. A hormone is a natural chemical in our bodies which can have an effect on various systems and also emotions. Listen out for the name of the hormone he mentions. 

Professor Huron
One of the things that we were interested in was ‘what’s the difference between people who listen to sad music and who love it, and people who listen to sad music and who just can’t stand it'. In our research, it started pointing towards a hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin, as you might have guessed from the name, is associated with ‘lactation’ from breast-feeding. When people cry, they also release prolactin. And, there are circumstances in which prolactin seems to have this comforting effect. 

Sam
So which hormone did he mention? 

Neil
He talked about the hormone called prolactin which he said was connected to lactation. This is the production of milk by mammals to feed their young. 

Sam
What he noted was that this hormone can be released when people cry and in some cases this hormone has a comforting effect. When something is comforting, it makes you feel better, it calms your emotions. Let’s listen again. 

Professor Huron
One of the things that we were interested in was ‘what’s the difference between people who listen to sad music and who love it, and people who listen to sad music and who just can’t stand it. In our research, it started pointing towards a hormone called prolactin. Now, prolactin, as you might have guessed from the name, is associated with ‘lactation’ from breast-feeding. When people cry, they also release prolactin. And, there are circumstances in which prolactin seems to have this comforting effect. 

Sam
So, what conclusions did he make about this hormone and how it might be working? Professor Huron explains. 

Professor Huron
So the thought was that, perhaps what’s going on is that the people who are enjoying listening to sad music are receiving some sort of excess of prolactin, and people who are listening to sad music and they just find it incredibly sad and unhelpful and they just don’t want to listen to it, maybe they’re not getting enough prolactin when they listen to the music. 

Sam
So what is happening? Or as Professor Huron said, what’s going on? 

Neil
Well, it seems quite simple, though I’m sure it’s very complicated. People who like sad music are maybe getting too much prolactin or more than is normal – he describes this as an excess of prolactin. And maybe people who don’t like sad music aren’t getting enough. 

Sam
So, the idea is that prolactin is a hormone which we find comforting. If our bodies release it when we hear sad music, it gives us a good feeling – but if prolactin isn’t released or there isn’t enough of it, we just find the sad music sad and it doesn’t help to cheer us up. 

Neil
I guess so, but you know emotions are funny things - it’s weird to think that our feelings are caused by different natural chemicals that run around the body. Absolutely! OK, we’re going to take another look at today’s vocabulary but first, the answer to this week’s quiz. The music video has been around for a while, but in what year was MTV, the first dedicated music video channel, launched in the US? Was it… 

And Neil, you said… 

Neil
I said it was definitely the early 80s. 

Sam
Well, you’re not wrong there, but which year exactly? 

Sam
Ah well, you’ll need to dig out a sad song to make you feel better now because the answer was 1981. 

Neil
Oh dear, I can feel my prolactin levels dropping already! 

Sam
I’m sure you can’t! But let’s move on to vocabulary. If you can’t stand something, it means you really don’t like it. 

Neil
A hormone is one of the body’s natural chemicals. 

Sam
And the hormone prolactin is connected with lactation, which is the production of milk by mammals. 

Neil
Something that is comforting makes you feel better emotionally. 

Sam
The phrase what’s going on has a very similar meaning to 'what’s happening'. 

Neil
And an excess of something is 'too much or a more than normal amount of that thing'. 

Sam
Well, before you have an excess of our company, we should wrap up. Thanks for listening and we hope you’ll join us again soon. As ever, don’t forget that you can find more from the BBC Learning English team online, across social media and on our very own app! Bye for now!

Sam
Hello. This is 6 Minute English. I'm Sam.

Rob
And I'm Rob.

Sam
Before you got your first job, Rob, did you do any work experience?

Rob
I think I may have done a day or two at some companies, just shadowing, watching how they did things – but nothing much more than that.

Sam
Some companies offer students or recent graduates what they call internships. These are extended periods of work experience where someone can be working full-time without an actual contract and in many cases without even being paid.

Rob
Ah – yes. This is a bit of a problem, isn’t it? Some companies are being accused of using students and graduates as cheap or free labour.

Sam
Yes, although the counter argument is that internships are valuable experience for people who need it before they can get a ‘real’ job. Well, we’ll look at this topic a little more after this week’s quiz question. On the topic of business and companies, which is the oldest stock exchange in the world? Is it:

A: Bombay

B: New York

C: Amsterdam

What do you think, Rob?

Rob
Tricky, because I was expecting London on that list. I’m going to take a guess then at Amsterdam.

Sam
OK. Well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme. James Turner is the chief executive of an education charity. Recently he took part in a discussion on the BBC radio programme You and Yours, on the topic of internships. What does he think is a big issue with unpaid internships?

James Turner, Chief Executive, The Sutton Trust
In many careers we’re now seeing that it’s almost as an expectation that a young person does an internship before they stand a chance of getting that first full-time job in that profession. And the issue with that from a sort of social mobility point of view is that a substantial proportion of those internships are unpaid and that effectively rules out those who can’t afford to work for free.

Sam
So what is the problem with unpaid internships, Rob?

Rob
Well, if you can’t afford to work for free, it makes it very difficult to do an internship – particularly in expensive cities like London. This excludes, or rules out a lot of people from the benefits of an internship.

Sam
This is bad for social mobility, which is the ability of people to move to higher, better paid levels in society. So the poorer you are the more difficult it can be to get a good job, even if you have the ability.

Rob
Could you afford to work for free here in London, Sam?

Sam
No, I can barely afford to live in London as it is, so the idea of doing an unpaid internship would not appeal to me at all. Turner goes on to talk about other issues that are also problematic in internship programmes.

James Turner, Chief Executive, The Sutton Trust
Too often internships are open to those with established connections in the professions and again that rules out those young people who don’t have the well-connected families or friends who can open those doors for them.

Sam
So what are these other issues?

Rob
In many cases he says that internship opportunities are only available to those with established connections to the company or industry. This means they have some pre-existing link with the company, for example, through family or friends’ families.

Sam
Yes, it’s a lot easier if your family is well-connected, if it has a lot of contacts and links to a particular company or important people in that company.

Rob
These links make it easier to open doors to the opportunity. To open doors is an expression that means to get access to.

Sam
So it seems that to be able to do an unpaid internships you need to have a fair bit of money and to get an internship in the first place you may need to have a previous link to the company through a family connection, for example.

Rob
So the system would seem to be difficult for poorer families and make it more difficult for students without those resources or connections to get on the job ladder. Here’s James Turner again.

James Turner, Chief Executive, The Sutton Trust
Too often internships are open to those with established connections in the professions and again that rules out those young people who don’t have the well-connected families or friends who can open those doors for them.

Sam
Right, time now to answer this week’s question. Which is the oldest stock exchange in the world? Is it:

A: Bombay

B: New York

C: Amsterdam

Rob, what did you say?

Rob
I went for Amsterdam.

Sam
Well done, that’s correct. Congratulations to everyone who go that right, and extra bonus points if you know the date. Rob?

Rob
Haven’t a clue! 1750?

Sam
Actually it’s a lot earlier, 1602.

Rob
Wow, that’s much earlier than I thought.

Sam
Right, let’s have a look again at today’s vocabulary. We’ve been talking about internships which are periods of work at companies as a way for students or new graduates to get experience in a particular field.

Rob
If they are unpaid it can make social mobility very difficult. This is the movement from a lower social level to a higher one and it’s difficult as poorer candidates can’t afford to work for free.

Sam
Yes, the cost rules them out, it excludes them from the opportunity.

Rob
What helps is if you have established connections with a company. This refers to previous or pre-existing links with a company.

Sam
And also if your family is well-connected, if it has good connections, for example if your father plays golf with the CEO, it can open doors, or in other words, it can make it easier to get into the company.

Rob
So Sam, are you well-connected?

Sam
No, only to my smartphone!

Rob
Same here – but we still made it to BBC Learning English and you can find more from us online, on social media and on our app. But for now, that’s all from 6 Minute English. See you again soon. Bye bye!

Sam 
Bye everyone!

Rob
Hello. This is 6 Minute English, and I'm Rob.

Sam
I'm Sam. Hello!

Rob
Now, Sam, we’re going to be talking about tattoos. Are you a fan?

Sam
Of tattoos? Well, I don’t have one, but they can be quite impressive works of art.

Rob
Well, I’m not that keen on tattoos – I mean, who wants things drawn on their body?!

Sam
It sounds like you need some convincing, Rob! Maybe our discussion today will change your mind.

Rob
Maybe. But as you’re a fan of them, here’s a question for you to answer. According to the Guinness World Records, the record for the most tattooed person in the world goes to Lucky Diamond Rich from New Zealand. Do you know how much of his body is covered by tattoos? Is it…

a)    80%?

b)    90%? Or

c)    100%?

What do you think, Sam?

Sam
Well, it’s got to be 100% if he is the most tattooed man, surely?

Rob
Not necessarily, but, we’ll see if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now let’s talk more about tattoos. I know many people have them. Sometimes it’s a picture of an animal, like a small gecko, sometimes it’s words like ‘I love you’ or the name of a loved one. And then there are the huge designs spread across someone’s back, chest or arm - like footballer David Beckham has.

Sam
Well, he’s no stranger to a tattoo parlour. A parlour is the name of the shop where a tattoo artist draws a tattoo on you with ink and a needle.

Rob
Needles! Ouch!

Sam
OK, you need some convincing, so let’s hear from Lucie Parfitt, YouTuber and tattoo fan. Here she is speaking on the BBC’s Smart Consumer podcast…

Lucie Parfitt, YouTuber
I’m quite a creative person and ever since I first discovered tattoos, I thought it was a really cool way of expressing yourself. I’m quite a visual person as well, so for me it really, like, just looked really cool and it made me think more about my own, like, personality and how I could express that in creative ways.

Rob
Right, so, Lucie describes herself as a creative person. When you’re creative you imaginative and like to experiment with new ideas.

Sam
Yes, Rob. And tattoos are a good way to be creative – trying out different designs and colours - it’s a good way to express yourself.  Here, to express yourself means 'to show how you feel in a particular way'.

Rob
OK, so some people express themselves through singing or wearing particular clothing, but here she’s expressing herself through the images on her skin. But what happens if you want change what you want to express?

Sam
Well, then it’s time for a new tattoo!

Rob
OK, well I know that the tattoo industry is big business now – which means it's 'popular and making lots of money'. I’ve heard that one in five people now have a tattoo.

Sam
Not you yet, Rob! But it has certainly become a trend in recent years and it’s something tattoo artist Lee Clements has noticed. Also speaking on the BBC’s Smart Consumer podcast, he explains why he thinks that is….

Lee Clements, tattoo artist
The thing for me that has obviously changed massively over the last, possibly, ten years is you see a lot of celebrities getting tattooed. With that comes the fact that you’re going to get people who want to copy them or it becomes almost like a fashion thing, so we do see certain tattoos, sort of , becoming a trend and… yeah, so I guess it kind of dilutes that value a little bit, yeah.

Rob
Ah so it’s celebrities – famous, well-known people from TV, film and fashion – that have possibly driven the trend. People want to copy them – or it’s what he says is ‘a fashion thing’, so you have a tattoo because it’s fashionable, which means it’s 'popular at a particular time'.

Sam
And one of the down sides – the negative things – about just having one to be fashionable is it dilutes the individuality of having one. Dilute means to 'make something less strong or less valuable'.

Rob
Well, I’m not going to get one anytime soon – except maybe a big six on my arm to remind me that we only have 6 minutes for this programme so I’d better reveal the answer to the question I asked you earlier. According to Guinness World Records, the record for the most tattooed person in the world goes to Lucky Diamond Rich from New Zealand. Did you know how much of his body is covered by tattoos?

Sam
And I said 100%.

Rob
Well done, Sam. That is correct. He has held the certified record since 2006 of being 100% tattooed. This includes tattoos inside his eyelids, mouth and ears.

Sam
Wow! I wonder who gets to see those!

Rob
OK well, now it’s time to recap the vocabulary we’ve discussed today starting with a parlour.

Sam
That’s the name for a shop or room where certain businesses carry out their trade – such as a tattoo parlour, a massage parlour or an ice cream parlour.

Rob
A creative person is someone who uses imagination and experiments with new ideas.

Sam
And when you express yourself, it means you 'show outwardly how you feel and what you’re thinking'.

Rob
If something is big business it is an activity that is currently popular and making lots of money.

Sam
And something that is fashionable is popular. And when something becomes popular it can dilute its value or uniqueness – so it becomes less strong or less valuable.

Rob
OK, thank you, Sam.  That’s all for now but there’s plenty more on our website at bbclearningenglish.com. If you can’t remember the address, why not tattoo it on your arm?! You can also find us on social media and on our app. Goodbye for now!

Sam
Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I'm Sam.

Georgina
And I'm Georgina. 

Sam
Georgina, what languages do you speak?

Georgina
Well, my mother tongue is English and I also speak Spanish and French badly!

Sam
OK. It’s interesting that we say ‘mother tongue’, isn’t it? Like many languages, English has a number of gender-specific terms that don’t refer to gender-specific ideas and concepts. And this complicated relationship between language and gender is what we will be talking about today. But first, this week’s quiz question, which is also on the topic of languages. Which of these languages is the newest? Is it:

A: Esperanto

B: Afrikaans

C: Light Warlpiri

What do you think, Georgina?

Georgina
Well, I’ve only heard of two of these - Esperanto and Afrikaans – so I think I’m going to choose the other one, Light Warlpiri, purely as I’ve never heard of it, so I think that must be the one.

Sam
OK, well we’ll find out if your intuition is correct later in the programme. Professor Lera Boroditsky is a cognitive scientist who was a guest on the BBC World Service programme, The Conversation. She was asked about why we use the term ‘mother tongue’ in English.

Professor Lera Boroditsky
Different languages actually do it differently, but definitely there’s a strong association between mothers as primary caregivers and people who teach us things, and so there’s that point of origin metaphor that applies in a lot of languages.

Sam
So, how does she explain the use of mother tongue, Georgina? 

Georgina
Well, she says it’s a form of metaphor. A metaphor is a way of describing something by comparing it to something else. In a metaphor,though, you don’t say that something is like something else, you say that it ‘is’ something else. For example, having good friends is the key to a happy life.

Sam
It is indeed. In this metaphor, language is seen as coming from your primary caregiver, the person who looked after you most when you were young, and traditionally this was mothers. 

Georgina
So, this is perhaps the point of origin, the starting place,of the metaphorical phrase, mother tongue. Let’s listen again.

Professor Lera Boroditsky
Different languages actually do it differently, but definitely there’s a strong association between mothers as primary caregivers and people who teach us things, and so there’s that point of origin metaphor that applies in a lot of languages.

Sam
Language is very powerful in society and culture, and when it comes to gendered language, it can cause some issues. Here’s Lera Boroditsky again:

Professor Lera Boroditsky
… in English of course we have some words that are gendered, like ‘actor’ and ‘actress’ or ‘waiter’ and ‘waitress’, and very commonly when there are those two gender forms people perceive the masculine form as being a more prestigious job or the more skilled job than the feminine form, so an actor is a fancier job than an actress and a waiter is a fancier job than a waitress, and so they could then come with pay disparities and so on.

Sam
So, what’s the subconscious difference in attitude towards, for example, an actor and actress? 

Georgina
Well, she says that people perceive those roles differently. This means that we are aware of, or believe there is a difference in the jobs because of the vocabulary. The male form is perceived to be more prestigious – more important, more respected, even though it’s exactly the same job. 

Sam
And this attitude can lead to problems such as disparities in pay. A disparity is a difference, an inequality, and in the world of work it can mean men getting paid more than women for the same job. Here’s Professor Boroditsky again. 

Professor Lera Boroditsky
…in English of course we have some words that are gendered, like ‘actor’ and ‘actress’ or ‘waiter’ and ‘waitress’, and very commonly when there are those two gender forms people perceive the masculine form as being a more prestigious job or a more skilled job than the feminine form, so an actor is a fancier job than an actress and a waiter is a fancier job than a waitress, and so they could then come with pay disparities and so on.

Sam
OK, before we take another look at today’s vocabulary, let’s reveal the answer to this week’s quiz. Which of these languages is the newest, is it:

A: Esperanto

B: Afrikaans

C: Light Warlpiri

Georgina, what did you say?

Georgina
I thought it had to be Light Walpiri, but just because I had never heard of it before.

Sam
Well, congratulations. Your instincts were good, that is correct. Let’s move on to vocabulary and look at today’s words and phrase again.

Georgina
A primary caregiver is a person who has most responsibility for looking after someone.

Sam
A point of origin is the place or time when something begins.

Georgina
A metaphor is a way of describing something. We can say that something is something else that has similar qualities.

Sam
You’re a star! 

Georgina
Aw, thank you.

Sam
No, I meant, you're a star, is an example of a metaphor.

Georgina
Oh, OK. Of course, I knew that. 

Sam
Mmmm, if you say so. To perceive is to think of something in a particular way. We might perceive the value of different jobs based on the vocabulary used to describe them.

Georgina
Something prestigious is important and respected.

Sam
And finally, a disparity is a difference, an inequality and is often used when talking about how men and women aren’t always paid the same for the same job. And that is all from us. We look forward to your company again soon. In the meantime, you can always find us online, on social media and on the BBC Learning English app. Bye for now.

Rob
Hello. This is 6 Minute English. I'm Rob.

Sam
And I'm Sam.

Rob
In this programme, we’re talking about biscuits.

Sam
Really? That’s not what I was told… oh hold on, you’re lying.

Rob
Yes, you’re right, Sam. I am lying simply to demonstrate our topic – lying and how to detect it. You detected my lie very easily, Sam!

Sam
I could tell by the smirk on your face that you were telling a fib – that’s the word for a small, inoffensive lie.

Rob
To be honest, talking about lie detecting will be much more interesting than biscuits. But first, let’s start with a question for you to answer. A competition is held in Cumbria in the UK every year to find and award the title of "The Biggest Liar in the World". But which type of people are not allowed to take part?

a)    Farmers

b)    Lawyers

c)    Estate agents

What do you think, Sam?

Sam
I’d be lying if I said I knew – but based on personal experience I’d say estate agents – they’d find it too easy!

Rob
Ha – well that’s your opinion but I’ll let you know if you’re right at the end of the programme. So, lying is something I’m sure a lot of us do – sometimes to avoid trouble, sometimes to cheat people, or sometimes just to impress someone – did you know I can speak seven languages, Sam?

Sam
That’s just a barefaced lie, Rob! But I can see how easy lying can be, and that’s what neuroscientist Sophie Scott thinks. Here she is on BBC Radio 4’s ‘Seriously’ podcast, explaining how we sometimes lie just to be nice!

Sophie Scott, neuroscientist
Often what we mean by lying is someone setting out to deceive us with their words or their actions but actually normal conversation probably can only happen because we don’t actually say all the time exactly what we really think and what we really mean. And that kind of cooperation is at the heart, I think, of a lot of social interactions for humans and I think that’s one of the strong pushes to make conversation polite and therefore frequently not actually truthful.

Rob
So Sophie mentions two types of lying. There’s the one when we try to deceive someone – so that’s trying to hide something by tricking someone to gain an advantage.

Sam
Hmm, that’s like you getting me to pay £10 for a cinema ticket when actually they were only £5. That’s just dishonest, but there are also what I like to call white lies – small lies we tell to avoid upsetting someone. Those are lies that aren’t intended to give you an advantage.

Rob
Yes, Sophie Scott says we use them in normal conversation – when we don’t say what we really mean.

Sam
So, we want to make conversation polite because we want to cooperate with each other – she says cooperation is at the heart. Something that’s at the heart is the most important or essential part.

Rob
Now telling lies is one thing but how do you know if we’re being lied to?  Sometimes there are telltale signs, such as someone’s face turning red or someone shuffling their feet.

Sam
But if you really want to know if someone is lying, maybe we should listen to Richard Wiseman, a psychologist at the University of Hertfordshire. Here he is speaking on the ‘Seriously’ podcast…

Richard Wiseman, psychologist, University of Hertfordshire
Liars in general say less. They tend to have a longer what's called response latency, which is the time between the end of the question and the beginning of the answer. And there also tends to be an emotional distance in the lie – so the words ‘me’,’my’, ‘I’ – all those things tend to drop away in lies and it’s much much harder for liars to control what they’re saying and how they’re saying it, so focus your attention there, you become a better lie detector.

Rob
Some good advice from Richard Wiseman. So to detect lies we need to listen out for the response latency – a term used in psychology to describe the time taken between a stimulus or question and a response to it. The bigger the gap, the more chance there is that someone is lying. Is that a good summary, Sam?

Sam
Sort of, Rob. Richard also suggests we focus on – or concentrate on – what and how people are saying things too. There’s probably more to it than just that.

Rob
Well now you know how to detect my lies, Sam, maybe honestly is the best policy – as they say. So I’m now going to give you an honest answer to the question I asked earlier. A competition is held in Cumbria, in the UK, every year to award the title of "The Biggest Liar in the World". But which type of people are not allowed to take part?

a)    Farmers

b)    Lawyers

c)    Estate agents

Sam
I guessed c) estate agents.

Rob
And you are wrong, I’m afraid. Lawyers, as well as politicians, are not allowed to enter the competition. It’s claimed "they are judged to be too skilled at telling porkies" – porkies is an informal word for ‘pork pies’ and that rhymes with ‘lies’.

Sam
Fascinating stuff, Rob and that’s no lie! But now, shall we recap some of the vocabulary we’ve heard today?

Rob
Why not? A fib is a small inoffensive lie.

Sam
A white lie is also a small lie, told to avoid upsetting someone.

Rob
When you deceive someone, you try to hide something by tricking them to gain an advantage.

Sam
When something is at the heart of something, it is the most important or essential part of it. And we heard about response latency – a term used in psychology to describe the time taken between a stimulus or question and a response to it.

Rob
OK, thank you, Sam. That’s all from 6 Minute English. We look forward to your company next time. Goodbye!

Sam
Hello, this is 6 Minute English. I'm Sam. 

Rob
And I'm Rob.

Sam
Are good at complaining, Rob?

Rob
Of course not. I’m British! I never complain, even when I get terrible service. It’s just too embarrassing.

Sam
Well, you might be in a minority now as it seems we British are complaining more than we used to. We’ll look at this topic a little more after this week’s quiz question. The oldest recorded complaint is on a stone tablet in the British Museum. It’s nearly 4000 years old. What was the complaint about?

a) An incorrect number of goats that were delivered after being bought at market
b) The quality of copper bars that were supplied, or
c) The non-payment of a bill for a banquet

What do you think, Rob?

Rob
I’m just going to guess at the goats. Someone bought a load of goats and fewer were delivered than were bought. That sounds good, but it’s just a guess.

Sam
OK. Well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme, and don’t complain if you get it wrong! You and Yours is a BBC radio programme about consumer affairs. On a recent programme they discussed the topic of complaining and customer service with Giles Hawke from an organisation called the Institute of Customer Service. He talks about different sectors. A sector is a particular area of business. Which sectors does he say have most problems when it comes to keeping the complaining customer satisfied?

Giles Hawke
The sectors that probably have more problems than the UK average are public services, telecommunications, transport and service sector. And there are probably some inherent challenges within those sectors - they may have more impact on a day-to-day basis. Those sectors which are performing well … travel is performing well, retail is performing well, leisure appears to be performing well.

Sam
So, which sectors are not keeping the customer satisfied?

Rob
He says that public services, telecoms, transport and the service sector have most problems.

Sam
And he says that these sectors may have inherent challenges. What does he mean by that?

Rob
Well, some sectors, by their nature, are more complicated and more likely to cause problems for customers. Public services, for example, often don’t have enough money or enough staff. Telecommunications systems, such as your internet connection, are very complicated and sometimes go wrong. Bad weather can affect transport, and so on. So an inherent problem is a problem that is part of the nature of the thing itself.

Sam
So, those sectors are not performing well. We usually think of the word perform when we are talking about actors or musicians, but in a business sense to perform well or badly means to be successful or not, and, according to Giles Hawke, travel and retail are performing well in terms of customer service.

Giles Hawke goes on to talk about how people are actually making their complaints, but are modern methods taking over from the traditional letter or phone call?

Giles Hawke
We still see over 58% of complaints are made by phone or by letter so, you know, the more traditional methods of making a complaint are still dominant, but we are seeing social media rise, although it’s still a very small part of how people complain and it tends to be used as an escalation point if people aren’t getting what they want dealt with in the first instance.

Sam
So, are people using modern methods more than traditional ones?

Rob
Actually, no. He says that phoning or writing a letter are still dominant. This means they are still the main, most used methods for making a complaint.

Sam
Where people are turning to social media is if their complaint is not dealt with. To deal with something means to sort it, to fix it – and if you complain and it’s not dealt with, then, he says, people turn to social media as a form of escalation.

Rob
When you escalate a complaint, you take it to a higher level. Putting your complaint on social media means that a lot more people are going to see it and it might encourage a company to deal with the complaint.

Sam
Right, well before we receive any complaints, let’s review today’s vocabulary after the answer to the question which was about a 4000-year-old complaint. Was the complaint about:

a) An incorrect number of goats that were delivered after being bought at market.
b) The quality of copper bars that were supplied, or
c) The non-payment of a bill for a banquet.

Rob, what did you say?

Rob
I went for a). I went for the goats.

Sam
Sorry! It was actually a complaint about the quality of copper ingots or bars that were supplied. If you knew that, very well done. If you guessed right, also, very well done. No shame to get that one wrong.

Rob
And no complaints from me!

Sam
OK. Right, now vocabulary. We had sectors,which are particular areas of business in the economy.

Rob
Something that is inherent is a natural part of something. It’s usually used to describe a problem or risk that is an unavoidable part of something.

Sam
How successful a company is can be describe as how well it’s performing. And if something is dominant, it means it is the strongest or most used.

Rob
And if a company doesn’t deal with, or try to fix a problem, the customer might take the complaint to the next level on social media, which would mean an escalation.

Sam

Neil
Hello. This is 6 Minute English. I'm Neil. 

Sam
And I'm Sam. 

Neil
Now Sam, I assume that you know your alphabet. 

Sam
Of course, Neil – you mean my ABCs? We learn that at a very young age, you know?

Neil
Sorry to sound patronising. But you do you know why the letters in the alphabet are in that particular order? 

Sam
No, I don’t. That’s really interesting. Why? 

Neil
I don’t know either, I was hoping you might! But seriously, no one really knows how the order became established. However, some research has shown that if your surname, your family name, begins with a letter later in the alphabet, you could be at a disadvantage at school and in life. Before we get in to that though, a question. Where does the alphabet come from in its earliest form? Was it…

a) Ancient Egypt
b) Ancient Greece
c) Ancient Rome

What do you think, Sam? 

Sam
Well, we refer to the English alphabet as having Roman characters, so I’m going with Ancient Rome.

Neil
OK. I’ll have the answer later in the programme. In the BBC radio programme Fry’s English Delight there was a feature about the alphabet and how it can have a negative impact on your school life. Can you remember all those years ago when you were at school? What’s the first thing that the teacher would do at the beginning of the day? 

Sam
She would take the register – that’s what we call it in the UK. You can also call it the roll call. 

Neil
Yes, this is when the teacher calls out the names of the students to check that they are all there. This is where the problem starts, according to, ironically, Professor Jeffrey Zax, from the University of Colorado. The further down that list your name is, the less noticed you are by the teacher. Why is that? Here’s Professor Zax. 

Professor Jeffrey Zax
When it begins people are paying attention. As it proceeds, first the people who are already called, they no longer have any need to take things seriously. And the people who are waiting to be called, their attention is wandering as well. And so as you make your way through the roll call somehow the intensity of the engagement diminishes. 

Neil
So, what is the problem? 

Sam
Well, it’s a lot to do with paying attention. This means concentrating on something. At the beginning of the roll call everyone is paying attention - they are quiet and listening. But after the first names are called, those students don’t need to pay attention any more.

Neil
So they lose a bit of interest in what comes next, and the students later in the list are also now distracted and the teacher, him or herself, is not so focussed. 

Sam
And by the end of the list the relationship between the teacher and the students whose names are being called later is not as strong as those at the beginning of the list. 

Neil
Professor Zax describes this by saying that the intensity of the engagement diminishes. Diminishes means ‘gets weaker’, and the intensity of the engagement is the strength of the communication, the level of enthusiasm for being involved. So this is the start of the disadvantage which can subtly affect students throughout their school years and after. This was discovered after some research in the US in the 1950s. So what were these disadvantages? Here’s Professor Zax again. 

Professor Jeffrey Zax
They were less likely to have enjoyed their high school courses, graduate from college if they applied. They were more likely to drop out. They had first jobs in occupations that paid less. They were more likely to go to the military and they were more likely to have jobs whose prestige was lower. 

Neil
So what disadvantages did they have? 

Sam
Well, Professor Zax says that the research showed they enjoyed school less, were less successful academically and more likely to drop out of college or university. This means that they left the course before it was finished. 

Neil
And he also said that they were more likely to find jobs that had a lower prestige. This means the jobs weren’t seen as high status or desirable. Let’s listen again. 

Professor Jeffrey Zax
They were less likely to have enjoyed their high school courses, graduate from college if they applied. They were more likely to drop out. They had first jobs in occupations that paid less. They were more likely to go to the military and they were more likely to have jobs whose prestige was lower. 

Sam
Well, Professor Zax seems to have done OK. Even with that surname! 

Neil
Indeed, I guess this doesn’t apply to everyone. Right, well before we remind ourselves of our vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. Where does the alphabet come from in its earliest form? Was it…

a) Ancient Egypt
b) Ancient Greece
c) Ancient Rome

Sam, what did you say? 

Sam
Pretty sure it’s Ancient Rome. 

Neil
What does your surname begin with? 

Sam
A 'B', actually. 

Neil
Well, you are wrong, I’m afraid. It’s actually Ancient Egypt – so well done to everyone who got that. OK, now it's time for our vocabulary. 

Sam
Yes – to pay attention to something means to concentrate on something, to not be distracted. 

Neil
Then there was the phrase the intensity of the engagement, which is another way of saying the strength of the relationship, interaction and communication. 

Sam
And if your surname comes at the end of the alphabet you may find that the intensity of engagement with the teacher diminishes. Diminishes means gets weaker. 

Neil
If you drop out from a course, it means that you leave it before it’s finished. 

Sam
And the prestige of a job is the respect it has. If it is seen as important or desirable then it has higher prestige. 

Neil
OK, thank you, Sam. That’s all from 6 Minute English. We hope you can join us again soon. You can find us at bbclearningenglish online, on social media and on our app. Bye for now! 

Faking it: Computers that spot a real smile

It's something Neil and Sam are discussing in 6 Minute English - as well as teaching you some useful vocabulary that will hopefully bring a smile to your face.

This week's question
The expressions we can make with our face are controlled by muscles. How many muscles do we have in our face? Is it:

A: 26
B: 43
C: 62

Listen to the programme to find out the answer.

Vocabulary

Neil
Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

Sam
And I'm Sam.

Neil
It’s good to see you again, Sam.

Sam
Really?

Neil
Yes, of course, can’t you tell by the way I’m smiling?

Sam
Ah well, I find it difficult to tell if someone is really smiling or if it’s a fake smile.

Neil
Well, that’s a coincidence because today’s programme is all about how computers may be able tell real smiles from fake smiles better than humans can. Before we get in to that though, a question. The expressions we can make with our face are controlled by muscles. How many muscles do we have in our face? Is it:

A: 26
B: 43
C: 62

What do you think, Sam?

Sam
No idea! But a lot, I’d guess, so I’m going with 62.

Neil
OK. Well, we’ll see if you’ll be smiling or crying later in the programme. Hassan Ugail is a professor of visual computing at the University of Bradford. He’s been working on getting computers to be able to recognise human emotions from the expressions on our face. Here he is speaking on the BBC Inside Science radio programme – how successful does he say they have been?

Professor Hassan Ugail
We've been working quite a lot on the human emotions, so the idea is how the facial muscle movement, which is reflected on the face, through obviously a computer through video frames and trying to understand how these muscle movements actually relate to facial expressions and then from facial expressions trying to understand the emotions or to infer the emotions. And they have been quite successful in doing that. We have software that can actually look at somebody's face in real time and then identify the series of emotions that person is expressing in real time as well.

Neil
So, have they been successful in getting computers to identify emotions?

Sam
Yes, he says they’ve been quite successful, and what’s interesting is that he says that the computers can do it in real time. This means that there’s no delay. They don’t have to stop and analyse the data, or crunch the numbers, they can do it as the person is talking.

Neil
The system uses video to analyse a person’s expressions and can then infer the emotions. To infer something means to get an understanding of something without actually being told directly. So, you look at available information and use your understanding and knowledge to work out the meaning.

Sam
It’s a bit like being a detective, isn’t it? You look at the clues and infer what happened even if you don’t have all the details.

Neil
Yes, and in this case the computer looks at how the movement of muscles in the face or facial muscles, show different emotions. Here’s Professor Ugail again.

Professor Hassan Ugail
We've been working quite a lot on the human emotions so the idea is how the facial muscle movement, which is reflected on the face, through obviously a computer through video frames and trying to understand how these muscle movements actually relate to facial expressions and then from facial expressions trying to understand the emotions or to infer the emotions. And they have been quite successful in doing that. We have software that can actually look at somebody's face in real time and then identify the series of emotions that person is expressing in real time as well.

Neil
So, how do the computers know what is a real or a fake smile? The computers have to learn that first. Here’s Professor Ugail again talking about how they do that.

Professor Hassan Ugail
We have a data set of real smiles and we have a data set of fake smiles. These real smiles are induced smiles in a lab. So, you put somebody on a chair and then show some funny movies and we expect the smiles are genuine smiles. And similarly we ask them to pretend to smile. So, these are what you'd call fake smiles. So, what we do is we throw these into the machine and then the machine figures out what are the characteristics of a real smile and what are the characteristics of a fake smile.

Neil
So, how do they get the data that the computers use to see if your smile is fake or genuine – which is another word which means real?

Sam
They induce real smiles in the lab by showing people funny films. This means that they make the smiles come naturally. They assume that the smiles while watching the funny films are genuine.

Neil
And then they ask the people to pretend to smile and the computer programme now has a database of real and fake smiles and is able to figure out which is which.

Sam
Figure out means to calculate and come to an answer

Neil
Yes, and apparently the system gets it right 90% of the time, which is much higher than we humans can. Right, well before we remind ourselves of our vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. How many muscles do we have in our face? Is it:

A: 26
B: 43
C: 62

Sam, are you going to be smiling? What did you say?

Sam
So I thought 62! Am I smiling, Neil?

Neil
Sadly you are not, you are using different muscles for that sort of sad look! Actually the answer is 43. Congratulations to anyone who got that right. Now our vocabulary.

Sam
Yes – facial is the adjective relating to face.

Neil
Then we had infer. This verb means to understand something even when you don’t have all the information, and you come to this understanding based on your experience and knowledge, or in the case of a computer, the programming.

Sam
And these computers work in real time, which means that there’s no delay and they can tell a fake smile from a genuine one, which means a real one, as the person is speaking.

Neil
They made people smile, or as the Professor said, they induced smiles by showing funny films.

Sam
And the computer is able to figure out or calculate whether the smile is fake or genuine.

Neil
OK, thank you, Sam. That’s all from 6 Minute English today. We look forward to your company next time and if you can’t wait you can find lots more from bbclearningenglish online, on social media and on our app. Goodbye!

Rob
Hello. This is 6 Minute English and I'm Rob. This is the programme where in just six minutes we discuss an interesting topic and teach some related English vocabulary. Well, joining me to do this is Sam.

Sam
Hello! So what’s our interesting topic today, Rob?

Rob
Something close to our hearts, Sam – it's travel.

Sam
Great!

Rob
But more and more of us are travelling to explore the world – many of us have more leisure time, and the cost of travelling has become relatively cheaper.

Sam
But here lies the problem – the places we’re visiting are becoming more crowded, sometimes spoiling the atmosphere and the beauty – the things we came to see in the first place!

Rob
This is why we’re going to be discussing how some cities around the world are putting restrictions on the tourists who visit. But that’s after I challenge you to answer this question, Sam! Are you ready?

Sam
Bring it on, Rob!

Rob
According to Mastercard’s Global Destination Cities Index, what was the most visited city in 2018? Was it…
a) London
b) New York, or
c) Bangkok?

Sam
All great places to visit – but I think I’ll stay close to home and say a) London.

Rob
OK. Well, as always I will reveal the answer later in the programme.
Now, let’s start our journey in Italy’s capital city, Rome. Famous for its Colosseum, Trevi Fountain and many other things.

Sam
Lots of people are visiting, Rob – and locals and tourists have differing attitudes towards the way they respect these beautiful and historic sites. Respect here is a verb, to mean treat something with care.

Rob
Well, the authorities in the city fear that some tourists are showing disrespect to the city and have introduced laws to clampdown on certain behaviour. Clampdown means officially trying to stop or limit people doing something. Sabina Castelfranco is a journalist in the city. She told BBC Radio 4’s You and Yours programme why new restrictions have been introduced…

Sabina Castelfranco, journalist
The new rules are really to make sure that tourists do not misbehave when they are visiting tourist attractions in Rome. Romans don't like to see tourists walking around bare-chested, they don't like to see them wading in their fountains - so really the objective is to improve the life of the city for residents and for tourists themselves.

Sam
So, the new rules are to stop tourists misbehaving – that’s doing bad or inappropriate things. I’m sure not all visitors misbehave – but those who have been, have been wading – that’s walking through water – in the famous fountains and men have not been covering up the top half of their bodies – so, going bare-chested.

Rob
Not any more, Sam! These new laws have banned this with the objective of improving the life for the people of Rome – the Romans. An objective is a plan or aim to achieve something.

Sam
Other laws introduced in Rome, with the objective of improving the city, include giving out severe fines to people who drop litter and to those who attach ‘love padlocks’ to historic monuments.

Rob
Well, I guess if it makes the city a nicer place to visit for everyone, then it’s a good idea.  Well, let’s talk about another historic old city – Bruges in Belgium. The old and narrow streets are often packed with sightseers – so restrictions have been introduced there. Helen Coffey, deputy travel editor for the Independent newspaper, also spoke to the You and Yours programme, to explain what is going on…

Helen Coffey, Deputy Travel Editor, The Independent
Bruges was the latest city to say we're going to introduce new regulations to crack down on what they called the Disneyfication of their city. A really key one is they're going to cap the number of cruises that can dock, and actually this a big one that lots of cities do. They basically don't like cruise visitors because cruise visitors don't spend money.

Sam
So Helen mentioned a crackdown – which like clampdown – means taking action to restrict or stop certain activities. And Bruges wants to crack down on the Disneyfication of the city.

Rob
This term describes turning something into an artificial, not real, commercial environment, similar to a Walt Disney theme park. I’m not sure it’s that similar yet, but one way to maintain the authentic feel of the city is to cap the number of cruises that can dock.

Sam
Cap means restrict or limit. It’s felt that visitors who come by cruise ship, don’t stay overnight and therefore don’t bring much money into the city. The message from the city authorities is ‘stay overnight or don’t come!’

Rob
Well, one city that has people visiting for the day or staying longer is the most visited city in the world – but where is that, Sam? Earlier I asked you what the most visited city in 2018 was? Was it…
a) London
b) New York, or
c) Bangkok?

Sam
And I said London.

Rob
That was in second place. The most visited city last year was Bangkok, in Thailand.

Sam
OK, Rob. Well, maybe what I can get right is a recap of today’s vocabulary. Starting with respect. If you respect something you treat it with care.

Rob
We also discussed clampdown, which means officially trying to stop or limit people doing something. Crackdown is a similar phrase.

Sam
To misbehave is to do something bad or inappropriate. And an objective is a plan or aim to achieve something.

Rob
Our next word is Disneyfication - a term that describes turning something into an artificial, not real, commercial environment, similar to a Walt Disney theme park.

Sam
And finally we had cap – which means restrict or limit. 

Rob
Well, we’ve had to cap this programme at 6 minutes – and we’re out of time. Goodbye!

Neil
Hello. This is 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

Sam
And I'm Sam.

Neil
Sam, have you considered the future of food much?

Sam
Well I think in the future I might have a sandwich – in about 30 minutes in the future.

Neil
Not quite what I meant! With the population of the world increasing along with the negative effects of climate change and other global issues, we might have to radically change our diets in the future.

Sam
Ah, yes I have heard about this – there are all sorts of developments from growing artificial meat to developing insect-based foods.

Neil
Mmm, tasty. Well we’ll look a little more at this topic shortly, but we start, as ever, with a question and it’s a food-based question. In which continent did tomatoes originate? Is it…

A: South America

B: Africa

C: Asia

What do you think, Sam?

Sam 
No idea. I’m going to say Africa, but that’s just a guess.

Neil
OK. Well I will reveal the answer later in the programme. On a recent edition of BBC Radio 4’s The Food Programme there was an interview with Dr Morgaine Gaye. She is a futurologist. A futurologist is someone who studies and predicts the way we will be living in the future. Her particular area of expertise is the subject of food. What two things does she say she thinks about?

Dr Morgaine Gaye
As a food futurologist, I think about not just what we’re going to be eating in the future but why. Why that thing, why that trend, why will people suddenly latch onto that food, that way of eating that food at that particular time? And when I work for large companies, that’s what they want to know. There is an element of a hunch. And then proving or disproving that hunch.

Neil
So, what two things does she think about?

Sam
She says that as a food futurologist she thinks about what we will be eating in the future and also why we will be eating that food.

Neil
Yes, in particular she looks at why there are particular trends. A trend is what is popular now or what is becoming popular. For example, at the moment there is a trend for eating less red meat.

Sam
She also looks at why people latch onto particular trends. To latch onto here means to be very interested in something. So if you latch onto a particular food trend, you start to follow that trend, you might start eating that particular diet.

Neil
Information about future trends is very important for companies in the food business. How does she actually predict these trends?

Sam
She says she starts with a hunch. A hunch is a feeling you get that something is true. You don’t have any real evidence, but your experience and knowledge makes you think you might be right.

Neil
Let’s listen again.

Dr Morgaine Gaye
As a food futurologist I think about not just what we’re going to be eating in the future but why. Why that thing, why that trend why will people suddenly latch onto that food, that way of eating that food at that particular time? And when I work for large companies, that’s what they want to know. There is an  element of a hunch. And then proving or disproving that hunch.

Neil
Dr Gaye goes on to talk about how on the subject of food, there are restrictions. Why is that?

Dr Morgaine Gaye
Food business of course has different restrictions around it because it’s about safety, we’re ingesting that. The supply chain and the labelling laws are very stringent especially in this country so it takes longer to get an ide­a from just a concept that’s discussed around a table to an actual production facility, labelled, branded, tested, marketed and put on the shelves.

Neil
So, why restrictions?

Sam
Well, it’s about safety. Because we are ingesting food, which is a way of saying we are putting it into our bodies, it has to be safe.

Neil
It can be a long process of developing a new food and getting it into the shops because of the need to be safe and meet the laws of different countries. In the UK she mentions that the food safety laws are very stringent. This means that the laws are very tough, very strict. Let’s hear Dr Gaye again.

Dr Morgaine Gaye
Food business of course has different restrictions around it because it’s about safety, we’re ingesting that, the supply chain and the labelling laws are very stringent especially in this country so it takes longer to get an ide­a from just a concept that’s discussed around a table to an actual production facility, labelled, branded, tested, marketed and put on the shelves.

Neil
Right, well before we review our vocabulary, let’s get the answer to the question. In which continent did tomatoes originate? Is it…

A: South America

B: Africa

C: Asia

Sam, what did you say?

Sam
I made a guess at Africa.

Neil
Well, I’m afraid that’s not right. Congratulations though to everyone who said South America. Right, let’s recap today’s words and expressions.

Sam
OK, well we started with the word futurologist. This is a noun to describe someone who studies and predicts the way we will be living in the future.

Neil
Then we had trend. This word can describe what is popular now and the way in which what is popular is changing. For example now we are seeing a trend for eating less red meat in some parts of the world.

Sam
If you latch onto something, you become interested in it and associate yourself with it – we heard that people very quickly latch onto food trends

Neil
Then there was hunch. A hunch is a feeling about something you think might be true even though you don’t have real evidence for it. Ingesting something means taking it into your body, so eating or drinking it.

Sam
And finally a stringent rule is a very strict rule, a tough rule or law which in connection to food is designed to make sure it is safe and of a suitable quality.

Neil
OK, thank you, Sam. That’s all from 6 Minute English. Goodbye!

Neil
Hello. This is 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

Sam
And I'm Sam.

Neil
Now, tell me about your teeth-cleaning routine.

Sam
OK. Well, it’s pretty good, I think. I brush twice a day and change my brush every couple of months.

Neil
And what kind of brush do you use?

Sam
Nothing fancy, just a regular, cheap plastic one.

Neil
Oh dear!

Sam
What do you mean?

Neil
Well, imagine all the toothbrushes you’ve used in your life, from your first brush as a child, to the one you currently have. You do realise that probably they all still exist in the environment somewhere. We use them for a couple of months yet they will last for hundreds of years.

Sam
Oh dear, and I thought I was actually quite environmentally aware. But that’s quite shocking. I hadn’t thought of that.

Neil
Well it’s just one of the problems we are facing with our use of plastics. A marvellous invention that has given us so much. But we are beginning to realise it's causing many long-lasting environmental problems. More on this topic shortly, but first, a question: Plastic has many natural variations but where was the first artificial plastic developed? Was it:

a)    England
b)    Germany or
c)    Switzerland?

What do you think, Sam?

Sam
I’m going to have a guess at Switzerland.

Neil
OK, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Environmental issues are, of course, a big story at the moment. The topic was featured on the BBC Woman’s Hour radio programme recently. Madeleine Murray is from an Irish organisation that gives advice to businesses and communities on how to operate in an environmentally responsible way. She was asked about what she does in her daily life that other people could do too. What food items does she mention?

Madeleine Murray
My personal, like, pet peeve is multipacks and minipacks. I buy in bulk now. I buy the biggest yoghurt I can buy. I buy big cereal boxes. I buy big shampoo bottles. We can decant stuff into lunch boxes and we can, you know, refill our pasta and our rice.

Neil 
So, what food does she mention, Sam?

Sam
She talked about yoghurt, cereal, pasta and rice.

Neil
And what was she saying about those foods?

Sam
She was saying that she buys the biggest containers for those that she can - and not just food - things like shampoo as well.

Neil
And what’s the benefit of that?

Sam
Well, she says that her pet peeve is small packs of things. A pet peeve is something that you find particularly annoying. She doesn’t like small packs because they use a lot of packaging for a small amount of product.

Neil
So she buys in bulk. Buying in bulk means 'buying a lot of something'. And if you have a lot of something like rice or pasta, you can always transfer it to different smaller reusable containers. She uses the word decant for this. So that’s one area where we can all be a bit more environmentally friendly. Another area is reusing things that are perfectly good but which we don’t need any more. Dr Tara Shine is a colleague of Madeleine Murray and she talked about how new parents often buy a lot of new things for their babies, which they then throw away when the child gets too big or too old. She suggests that it’s better to pass these things on -to give them to other people.

Dr Tara Shine
Pass things on. The hand-me-down, pass-thing-on culture is really, really important in the world of kids and there are lots of things that can be passed down, whether it’s toys or the equipment, or the high chair, whatever it is, all of that can be passed on and that’s really important. It’s saving someone else money. Most of these things are in good nick when we need to pass them on.

Neil
She used another expression for passing things on, didn’t she?

Sam
Yes, she talked about the hand-me-down culture. When I was growing up, I had a lot of hand-me-downs. These were toys and clothes from my older cousins, which saved us a lot of money and they were then passed on to someone else.

Neil
And the thing is children grow up quickly so often everything is in good condition.

Sam
Dr Shine used an interesting expression for that, didn’t she? She said most of these things are in good nick. That expression means 'in good condition'.

Neil 
Now, before we recycle today’s vocabulary …

Sam
Oh, very good, I see what you did there!

Neil
It’s time for the answer to today’s question. Where was the first artificial plastic developed? Was it:

a)    England
b)    Germany or
c)    Switzerland?

What did you think, Sam?

Sam
I guessed Switzerland.

Neil
Well, I'm afraid, you are wrong. The correct answer is actually, England. Well done if you got that right. Extra bonus points if you knew that in 1856 Alexander Parkes patented Parkesine, the first artificial plastic. Now, let’s recap today’s words and expressions.

Sam
Yes, a pet peeve is something that someone finds particularly annoying.

Neil
Buying in bulk means 'buying many of the same things or a large quantity of something'. Buying in bulk is usually cheaper and can be better environmentally.

Sam
And if you have a lot of something, you can decant it to smaller containers, that is, you can transfer it to those other containers to make it easier to use. For example: I buy huge bottles of liquid soap and decant it into smaller dispensers for the kitchen and bathrooms.

Neil
You can pass on clothes, toys and other kids' stuff to family and friends. This means 'giving them to other people to use'. And those things can be described as hand-me-downs.

Sam
But of course you’d only want to pass on things in good nick, that is, 'in good condition'.

Neil
Right, that's all we have time for. We hope you will join us again soon, though. And you can always find us on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, Instagram, online and on our app. We are BBC Learning English. See you soon. Good-bye!

Transcript 
Note: This is not a word for word transcript   

Neil
Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I'm Neil.

Sam
And I'm Sam.

Neil
Sam, do you remember the first time you voted?

Sam
No I don’t, but I remember being very keen to do it. It would have been the first election after my 18th birthday.

Neil
So, over the many, many, many years since then …

Sam
… eh, not so much with the ‘manys’ if you don’t mind Neil!

Neil
In the very, very few years since then …

Sam
That’s more like it!

Neil
In the years since then, have your political views changed very much?

Sam
I think my political views are a lot better informed now. I think the decisions I make are based on a better understanding of the political situation – but I still generally agree with the same things I did when I was younger, I think.

Neil
There is a belief that as we get older we become more right-wing in our political views and opinions. Is this true and if so, why? We’ll be finding out a little bit more about this, but first a question. What was the first UK general election in which 18-year-olds could vote?
A: 1929
B: 1950, or
C: 1970
So, what do you reckon then Sam?

Sam
Well, they were all before my time. I’m going to say 1950 – that sounds about right – it was the decade in which teenagers were invented, after all!

Neil
OK. Well, I will reveal the answer later in the programme. James Tilley is a professor of politics at the University of Oxford. He appeared recently on BBC Radio 4’s programme Analysis and was asked why, if it is true, do we become more right-wing as we get older. What does he think?

Professor James Tilley 
The question that age affects our political views is a tricky one. I think probably the most plausible explanation is that people just generally become a bit more resistant to change as they get older and I think also that they also tend to perhaps, become less idealistic.

Neil
So, what reasons does he give?

Sam
Well, he talks about what he thinks are the most plausible explanations. Plausible is an adjective which means something is believable; it’s reasonable and it makes sense.

Neil
And what are the plausible explanations?

Sam
Well, he says that generally, as we get older, we like to have more stability in our lives, we don’t like change, in fact we are resistant to change. That means we are against change. When we are younger we might like the idea of revolution, we might be very idealistic. This means, for example, we might think that we can and should change the world to make things better. This would cause big changes in the world which when we are older and more settled in our lives, do not seem like such a good idea.

Neil
Let’s listen again.

Professor James Tilley 
The question that age affects our political views is a tricky one. I think probably the most plausible explanation is that people just generally become a bit more resistant to change as they get older and I think also that they also tend to become less idealistic.

Neil
Professor Tilley goes on to explain more about why being resistant to change might lead people to support more right-wing policies.

Professor James Tilley
So, if parties on the right represent a platform which is perhaps more favourable to the status quo, it’s perhaps more about pragmatism than it is about idealism, then that might be more attractive to older people than younger people.

Neil
So, what is seen as the appeal of moving to the right?

Sam
Political parties have a particular set of policies. This is sometimes known as their platform. Professor Tilley says that if their platforms support the status quo, they might be more attractive to older people. The status quo is a Latin phrase we use in English to refer to the situation as it is now – that is, one that is not going to change. Traditionally it’s parties of the centre right that seem to be more supportive of the status quo.

Neil
So, as we get older he says our political views are less about idealism and more about pragmatism. Pragmatism is being practical and realistic about what can be achieved and how it can be achieved.

Sam
But of course this doesn’t apply to everyone and just because people seem to move more to the right as they get older doesn’t mean that they completely change their politics.

Neil
Let’s hear Professor Tilley again.

Professor James Tilley
So, if parties on the right represent a platform which is perhaps more favourable to the status quo, it’s perhaps more about pragmatism than it is about idealism, then that might be more attractive to older people than younger people.

Neil
Right, let’s get the answer to our question. What was the first UK general election in which 18-year-olds could vote?
A: 1929
B: 1950, or
C: 1970
Sam, what did you say?

Sam
I thought it was 1950.

Neil
Well, you’re wrong I’m afraid. The correct answer is1970. 18-year-olds have been allowed to vote in the UK since 1969 and the first general election after then was in 1970. So, a bit later than you thought, Sam, but congratulations to anyone who did get that right. OK, let’s remind ourselves of our vocabulary.

Sam
Yes, first we had plausible. An adjective that means ‘believable and possible’.

Neil
Being resistant to something means you are against it and don’t want it to happen.

Sam
If you are idealistic you have a clear and simple moral view of how things should be.

Neil
This contrasts with one of our other words, pragmatism, this noun is the idea of being realistic and practical about what can be achieved.

Sam
A platform can describe the policies and ideas of a political party or politician. And the status quo is the unchanging situation as it is now.

Neil
OK, thank you Sam. That’s all from us in this programme. Do join us again and if you can’t wait you can find lots more from BBC Learning English online, on social media and on our app. Goodbye!

Transcript 
Note: This is not a word for word transcript  

Catherine
Hello. This is 6 Minute English, I'm Catherine. 

Sam
And I'm Sam. 

Catherine
Now, Sam, what can you tell us about cryptocurrencies? 

Sam
The word is a combination of crypto, from cryptography, which is to do with using clever software codes to protect computer information and systems, and currency, which is the money of a particular country. So cryptocurrency, very simply, meanscode money. We usually think of money as notes and coins which come from a country’s bank. But a cryptocurrency doesn’t have physical money. It’s purely digital and is not controlled by banks or governments but by the people who have it and very complex computer codes. Perhaps the most well-known is Bitcoin. 

Catherine
Well, you seem to know a fair bit about cryptocurrency actually… anyway, now a new player is joining the digital money system as Facebook have announced they are launching their own digital currency. They are calling it 'Libra'. And we’ll be finding a little bit more about this topic in the programme, but first, a question. Now, Sam, you mentioned Bitcoin as being a well-known cryptocurrency. It was, in fact, the first cryptocurrency, but when was Bitcoin created? Was it:

a) 2008
b) 2009 or
c) 2010?

Sam
I’m going to say 2010. 

Catherine
OK. Well, I'll reveal the answer later in the programme. Now, Jemima Kelly is a financial journalist. She was talking on the BBC radio programme Money Box Live about the plans for Libra. She says it's not really a cryptocurrency because it's actually backed up by a number of real currencies. So which currencies does she mention? 

Jemima Kelly
A cryptocurrency is normally subject to the whims of crypto markets, which are notoriously volatile, whereas Libra is kept stable by being backed up by a basket of currencies, in this case, the dollar, the pound, the euro and the Swiss franc.

Catherine
So which currencies did she say were backing up Libra, Sam? 

Sam
She said that the dollar, the pound, the euro and Swiss franc were the currencies that would be backing up Libra. 

Catherine
And this is different from regular cryptocurrencies, isn’t it? 

Sam
Yes, cryptocurrencies are completely independent of financial institutions and other currencies. 

Catherine
And this can make them risky, can’t it? 

Sam
Yes, she says that cryptocurrency markets are notoriously volatile. Something that is volatile can change very quickly. When it comes to currency, it means that its value can go up or down by a large amount over a very short period of time. 

Catherine
And it’s described as notoriously volatile because this has actually happened a few times in the past. Something that is notorious is well known or famous but for a negative reason. So the value of a currency going up and down in a volatile way – that's not positive. 

Sam
If you want to take the risk you could make a lot of money, but you could also lose a lot of money - more than you invested. 

Catherine
So why are cryptocurrencies so volatile? 

Sam
Most currencies are reasonably stable. This is the opposite of volatile. They don’t change a lot over a short period of time. There can be big changes but usually governments and banks control currencies to prevent it. Cryptocurrencies don’t have those controls. What Jemima Kelly said was that they are subject to the whims of the crypto markets. A whim is an unpredictable or irrational decision or trend and if you are subject to the whims of something, or someone, it means that metaphorically you are a passenger in a self-driving car which may decide just to drive off the edge of a cliff. So it might be an exciting ride, but it could end in disaster. 

Catherine
Right, it’s time now to get the answer to the question I asked at the beginning of the programme. Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency, but when was it created? Was it:

a) 2008
b) 2009
c) 2010?

Sam
I said 2010, but I’m not really sure. 

Catherine
And you're absolutely wrong! The correct answer is 2009, so no luck for you this time, but congratulations to everyone who did get that right. Well, anyway, let’s round off today with a review of today’s vocabulary.

Sam
First off there is cryptography which is the use of special codes to keep computer systems and content safe. 

Catherine
A currency is the money of a particular country, for example in the UK we have the pound, in the US there’s the dollar and in many countries in Europe the currency is the euro. 

Sam
Cryptocurrency is a combination of cryptography and currency and it’s used for a finance system that is based on secure digital coins that are not connected to banks or governments. 

Catherine
We then had the expression subject to the whims of. Whims are unpredictable decisions and if you are subject to them it means you can’t control them, you have no choice but to go in the direction those whims lead. 

Sam
This means that the value of cryptocurrencies are notoriously volatile. They have a history of going up or down in value by large amounts and very quickly. And that’s not good. 

Catherine
Well, it might be good if it goes up!

Sam
True.

Catherine
But if you want less risk, if you want your currency to be the opposite of volatile, if you want it, in other words, to be stable, then maybe cryptocurrencies are not for you. 

Sam
Well, we are subject to the whims of the schedule which means our 6 minutes are up. We look forward to your company again soon. Bye for now. 

The art of tipping

Introduction
Tipping at a restaurant or cafe is a complicated issue. Should you leave a cash tip or is a card just as good? Do you prefer to pay a fixed service charge or do you think the whole thing is unnecessary? In 6 Minute English we discuss this tricky subject and discover some regional variations. Plus we serve up some useful vocabulary.

This week's question
What is the biggest tip that we know somebody gave? Is it…

A: $10,000
B: $250,000
C: $3,000,000

The answer is at the end of the programme.

Vocabulary
tipping
giving someone extra money as a 'thank you' for good service

i.e.
Short for the Latin phrase 'id est' and means 'in other words' or 'that is'. It's used to indicate that what comes next is a clear definition of what was just said or written.

differs
is different

the norm
normal or usual

tacit
not spoken or written but still understood

theoretically
adverb used to describe something that can be done but probably won't be

Catherine
Hello. This is 6 Minute English and I'm Catherine.

Sam
And I'm Sam.

Catherine
Sam, how do you feel about tipping?

Sam
Tipping? You mean giving extra money to people in certain jobs for doing their jobs?

Catherine
Well, I wouldn’t put it quite like that. But yes, it’s giving money to waiters and waitresses, hairdressers, taxi drivers - money that is more than the actual bill.

Sam
It’s a nightmare! I never know who to tip, how to tip, by cash or by card, how much to tip – is it 10, 12.5, 20 per cent or even if I should tip at all because in some places a service charge is automatically added to the bill.

Catherine
Yes, tipping is a really complicated issue which we will be looking at in this programme. But to start with, a question. What is the biggest tip that we know somebody gave? Is it…

A: $10,000, is it…
B: $250,000, or is it…
C: $3,000,000?

What do you think, Sam?

Sam
I’m going to go for $250,000.

Catherine
OK, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Now, back to the topic of tipping and in particular, tipping people who work in restaurants. William Beckett runs a number of restaurants and he recently appeared on the BBC Food Programme. He was asked about his view of tipping. Now as we hear him, listen out for this information: in how many cities does he say he currently has restaurants?

William Beckett
It is cultural, i.e. it differs from place to place. I mean, we have restaurants in London, we have a restaurant in Manchester, we’re also opening a restaurant in New York and those three cities have quite different attitudes to tipping. In London, the norm is, it’s there, it’s on your bill. That’s not the norm, for example, in Manchester and it’s not the norm in New York where we’re going to open a restaurant later this year.

Catherine 
So, first, how many cities does he currently have restaurants in?

Sam
That would be two. London and Manchester. He's going to open one in New York later in the year, but it's not open yet.

Catherine
And what does he say about tipping?

Sam
Well, he says that it is very cultural. What is the norm in one city is not necessarily the norm in another. The norm is an expression that means, as you might guess, what is normal, what is usual.

Catherine
So in London, for example, a service charge is usually added to the bill, but in Manchester it isn’t. So the policy in London and Manchester differs which means, again as you might guess, it's different.

Sam
There's another short expression that he used that I'd like to highlight. Before he talks about how the policies differ, he says i.e. These two letters stand for the Latin phrase 'id est'. Now we never say 'id est' but we do write and say i.e. We use it to show that what comes next is using different words to say what we have just said or written. So he says, about tipping, it's cultural i.e. it differs from place to place. 'It's cultural' is a more general statement and 'it differs from place to place' is a more specific definition of what he means.

Catherine
So, one difference is that in some places people prefer an automatic service charge so that they don't have to think about or try to calculate a tip. But in other places, people hate that - they want to decide who and how much to tip themselves. But do people actually make use of that freedom not to tip? Here’s William Becket again and this he's time talking about New York.

William Beckett
New York exactly the same. There's a tacit pressure to tip. But theoretically you just stand up and walk out. You don't, everybody tips 20% or, there is a theory of an option. But people like that.

Catherine
So he says there is a tacit pressure to tip. What does he mean by that?

Sam
Something that is tacit is not spoken, not said, yet it is still understood. So in New York no one tells you that you have to tip, but everyone knows that you have to.

Catherine
And because there is no service charge on the bill and no one tells you what to tip, you could just walk out after paying. He says that's theoretically possible. That means although it may be possible it's actually very unlikely because of the tacit pressure and the way we behave.

Sam
But he does say people like that freedom not to tip, even if they don't actually use that freedom.

Catherine 
Right, nearly vocabulary time, but first, let's have the answer to our question. Now Sam what is the biggest tip we know someone gave?

Sam
I thought $250,000.

Catherine
Well it was actually, believe it or not, a whopping $3,000,000. Yes! Now, on with today's vocabulary review.

Sam
Right. So we've been talking about tipping, the practice of giving extra money to, for example, waitresses and waiters.

Catherine
To differ from is a verb which means to be different from.

Sam
The norm is what is usual or normal.

Catherine
i.e. is a short form of a Latin expression and it means 'in other words'.

Sam
Something that is tacit is not said but is nevertheless understood.

Catherine
And if something is theoretically possible it can be done but for different reasons it probably won't be. And that is where we must leave it today. Goodbye!

Coffee cups: Do you use your own?

Introduction
Most takeaway coffee cups are not recyclable because they're lined with plastic. One big coffee shop chain has introduced a 5p levy for using a disposable cup to encourage people to bring their own; another one pledged to recycle as many disposable coffee cups as they produce by 2020. Neil and Rob discuss if this is enough to encourage coffee drinkers to behave in a more environmentally-friendly way. And they teach you related vocabulary.

This week's question
Which country drinks the most coffee per capita – so not the total amount of coffee but the average per person. Is it:

a) Japan

b) Kenya

c) Finland

Listen to the programme to find out the answer.

Vocabulary
disposable
designed to be thrown away after a short time

reusable
designed to be used many times

rolling out
gradually introducing something new to a business

infrastructure
buildings or structures that are needed for something to work.

a nudge
a gentle push

to fight (something) tooth and nail
to make a strong effort against something

Neil
Hello, and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

Rob
And I'm Rob.

Neil
Now Rob, we’ve talked before on this programme about our love of coffee.

Rob
Oh yes, indeed. I couldn’t function without it.

Neil
But have you ever thought about the environmental consequences of all those disposable coffee cups?

Rob
Oh yes, indeed. I always carry a reusable cup with me so I don’t have to throw one away.

Neil
So if a disposable cup is one you throw away, a reusable one is one that you can use again and again.

Rob
Yes, there is a big problem with disposable cups in that many of them can’t be recycled, so there is a lot of waste for something we only use for a short time.

Neil
What are the big coffee shop chains doing about this problem? We’ll find out a little bit more shortly, but first, a quiz for you. Which country drinks the most coffee per capita – so not the total amount of coffee but the average per person. Is it:
a) Japan
b) Kenya, or
c) Finland
What do you think, Rob?

Rob
Ooh, tricky. I don’t think the Japanese are big coffee drinkers and I know they produce a lot of coffee in Kenya. I’m surprised the USA isn’t on the list but I’m going to go with Finland. Just because.

Neil
Well, we'll see if you're right later in the programme. On a recent BBC You and Yours radio programme they discussed the topic of coffee cups. Some of the big chains are now charging customers more for a disposable cup and giving discounts if people bring their own reusable. However not all of the shops actually collect old cups and sort them for recycling in the shop itself. Here’s Jaz Rabadia from Starbucks, Is the store only interested in facilities inside their shops?

Jaz Rabadia 
It is something that we are in the process of rolling out and it will be in all of our stores. It's also not just our stores in which these cups end up. So we're doing a lot of work outside of our store environment to ensure that paper cups can be recycled on the go. We're working with our environmental charity partner Hubbub to increase recycling infrastructure outside of our stores because that too is where a lot of our cups will end up.

Neil 
So are they just working in their stores at improving recycling?

Rob
Well no, after all most people take their coffee out of the stores, so they are working on recycling infrastructure outside as well. This will be things like bins and collection points which are clearly marked for coffee cups.

Neil
And what about enabling recycling cups in store?

Rob
Well she said that was something they are rolling out to all stores. Rolling out here means introducing over a period of time. So it’s starting to happen, but is not finished yet.

Neil
Let’s listen again.

Jaz Rabadia
It is something that we are in the process of rolling out and it will be in all of our stores. It's also not just our stores in which these cups end up. So we're doing a lot of work outside of our store environment to ensure that paper cups can be recycled on the go. We're working with our environmental charity partner hubbub to increase recycling infrastructure outside of our stores because that too is where a lot of our cups will end up.

Neil
Not everyone, however, believes that the coffee chains are doing everything that they can. This is Mary Creagh, a member of the British parliament. She compares the situation to that of the plastic bag charge. This was a law brought in to force shops to charge customers for plastic bags, which previously had been free.

Mary Creagh MP
If you think you’re having to pay extra for something, as we saw with the plastic bags, we think a similar psychological measure is needed, a nudge measure, to encourage people to remember to bring their reusable cup with them and of course this is something that the coffee shops have been fighting tooth and nail.

Neil
She thinks that we consumers need a nudge to help us remember our reusable cups.

Rob
Yes, we need a nudge, which is a little push, a reason. In this case, she is thinking of a law to make them charge more. But she says the coffee chains really don’t want this, they are, she says, fighting it tooth and nail. If you fight something tooth and nail you are against it completely and try to stop it.

Neil
Let's hear MP Mary Creagh again. 

Mary Creagh MP
If you think you’re having to pay extra for something, as we saw with the plastic bags, we think a similar psychological measure is needed, a nudge measure, to encourage people to remember to bring their reusable cup with them and of course this is something that the coffee shops have been fighting tooth and nail. 

Neil 
Time to review our vocabulary, but first, let’s have the answer to the quiz question. Which country drinks the most coffee per capita? Is it:
a) Japan
b) Kenya, or
c) Finland
What did you think, Rob? 

Rob
I took a bit of a guess at Finland. 

Neil
Well, congratulations, your guess was correct. The Finns on average get through an amazing 12kg of coffee a year, each. Now, onto the vocabulary.

Rob
We had a couple of related but opposite words. Something disposable is designed to be used once or a few times and then thrown away and a reusable is designed to be used again and again. 

Neil
We then had rolling out which in a business sense is the process of gradually introducing something new. This could be a new system, new product, new technology or even a new way of doing things. 

Rob
New ideas often need new infrastructure. This is usually physical structures that are needed to make something work, for example rail infrastructure includes tracks, stations and signals. 

Neil
A nudge is a small push, to encourage us to do something. You don’t need a nudge to carry a reusable coffee cup, do you? 

Rob
Oh, no, I’m all for it. In fact I’d fight tooth and nail to keep hold of my reusable. Which is quite a coincidence as that was our last expression today. To fight tooth and nail means to make a strong effort to try to stop something or achieve something. 

Neil
Well, that’s all from us. We look forward to your company next time. Until then, you can find us in all the usual places on social media, online and on our app. Just search for 'BBC Learning English'. Goodbye!

Sam
Hello, I’m Sam and welcome to 6 Minute English. This is the programme where in just six minutes we discuss an interesting topic and teach some related English vocabulary. Joining me to do this is Rob.

Rob
Hello.  And today we’re talking about fraud.

Sam
Fraud is the criminal activity of getting money by deceiving people – or tricking people by doing something dishonest.

Rob
There are many ways to do this – and much of it is happening online these days.

Sam
We’ll talk more about this in a moment. But first, a very honest quiz question for you to answer, Rob. According to UK Finance – an organisation that represents the British banking industry – how much money did criminals steal through fraud and scams last year? Was it…

a)    £1.2m

b)    £120m, or

c)     £1.2bn?

Rob
Well, I imagine it’s quite a lot – so I’ll say £120m.

Sam 
We'll find out if you're right later in the programme. Now, I just mentioned the word scam, which is an illegal way of making money by tricking someone. We may think that we’ll never be scammed, but already millions of people have fallen for fake emails, phone calls or letters that look genuine and ask us to give or update our financial details.

Rob
To fall for means to believe something that is a trick or a lie, to be true. This year, for example, thousands of people in the UK fell for a fraudulent – or fake – email, requesting that people update their direct debit details for paying their TV licence. That's a payment we have to make in the UK to fund the BBC.

Sam
This is something the BBC Radio 4 programme, You and Yours, has been discussing. Its BBC Fraud investigator reporter, Shari Vahl, explained why it was easy to be deceived…

Shari Vahl, BBC Fraud investigator reporter
It's a sleight of hand fraud. The criminals get you to look over there whilst they rifle your pockets and I have the email here and it looks completely convincing. All the right logos, all the right fonts. It just says that my direct debit on my TV licence has failed and I need to pay it. It’s very polite.

Sam
So some great language there. She said that this scam was a sleight of hand fraud. Sleight of hand means the use of clever skill to gain something dishonestly – in this case, money.

Rob
As Shari said, the criminals get you to, metaphorically, look over there whilst they rifle your pockets. Rifle means search something in order to steal from it – so to steal from your pocket – very dishonest!

Sam
Now, like in this case, fraudsters – the people who commit fraud – gained financial information by phishing. That’s not fishing using a rod, line and hook, but by sending an email that looked like it came from your bank, asking for confidential information.

Rob
But banks do warn us not to give away our financial details online and to change our passwords regularly.

Sam
But sometimes criminals are very clever in what they do and it’s easy to be fooled. The You and Yours programme also heard about this from social engineer, Jenny Radcliffe. What does she call this type of fraud?

Jenny Radcliffe, social engineer
The more sophisticated frauds are ones that have been thought through very carefully. And this has been thought through. It’s a fraud that can be layered so you know we're getting some information from you. What you really look for is a window into someone - a key that unlocks just a small part of their identity or their personal data and from that a good fraud will build and build and build on it until the consequences to some people can be completely devastating.

Rob
So Jenny Radcliffe is talking about sophisticated fraud. That means it’s clever and often complicated – so it can confuse us.

Sam
Yes, criminals need just a small piece of information about us – a key – that can eventually open up our identity and expose our personal data.

Rob
And as Jenny says, for victims of fraud the consequences – the outcome – can be very bad. Especially if somebody loses all their hard-earned savings – it can devastating.

Sam
Of course banks and security companies are working hard to beat the criminals but it still remains a problem and earlier I asked you, Rob. According to UK Finance, how much money did criminal steal through fraud and scams last year?

Rob
And I said b) £120m. That’s a lot of money.

Sam
It is but it’s even more. In 2018, criminals successfully stole £1.2 billion through fraud and scams – and that’s just in the UK – globally it’s even more.

Rob
Well, it certainly is a serious issue but hopefully we haven’t deceived you with the vocabulary we’ve discussed today.

Sam
Hopefully not! We’ve been talking about fraud – that’s the criminal activity of getting money by deceiving people – or tricking people by doing something dishonest.

Rob
Next we had scam - which is an illegal or dishonest way of making money by tricking someone. The people who do it are scammers.

Sam
We talked about the phrasal verb fall for. When you fall for something you believe something that is a trick or a lie, to be true.

Rob
Then we heard about sleight of hand which means use of clever skill to gain something dishonestly. And rifle, which means search something in order to steal from it.

Sam
Phishing, spelt with a ph, means tricking someone by email or online to get their personal data by pretending to be from your bank. Finally, we discussed sophisticated fraud. When something is sophisticated, it’s clever and often complicated.

Rob
Unlike our programme, Sam!

Sam
Let’s hope so but now, we’ve reached the end of the programme.

Rob
See you again soon. Bye! 

Is shame always bad?

Neil
Hello, and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil. 

Sam
And I'm Sam. 

Neil
In this programme we'll be talking about the emotion of shame. What can you tell us about this word, Sam? 

Sam
Well, it can be a verb or a noun. As a noun it's an emotion for the uncomfortable feeling we have when we feel embarrassed or guilty about something that we've done. It’s a very strong feeling. 

Neil
We’ll explore this topic in more detail shortly, but first a question. Now it might seem like a random question, but all will become clear later, I promise. The chemical which was used to make cooking pans non-stick was discovered by accident, when was this? Was it…
a) 1930s
b) 1960s or
c) 1980s
What do you think, Sam? 

Sam
Ah – well, first, I've no idea what non-stick cookware has to do with our topic of shame but as to the question itself, I think it has something to do with Nasa and the space programme, so I’m going to say 1960s. 

Neil
Well, we will find out later in the programme if you are right. The idea of shame is not new, by any means, but social media has made it a very modern concept, hasn’t it? 

Sam
Yes, when it’s used as a verb, to shame someone, it means to say or write things in public designed to make other people feel bad about their behaviour and this is something we see a lot In social media. 

Neil
This topic was discussed on a recent edition of the BBC radio programme Woman’s Hour. One of the guests was Hetta Howes from City University, London. Does she think that shame is always a bad thing? 

Hetta Howes
If you have too much shame it’s crippling, it's sort of debilitating and that’s bad, but the right amount of shame can be really positive because it effects change and I wonder if we’re starting to see that a bit in modern culture as well from sort of social media platforms because if someone’s done something that we consider to be a little bit wrong, we can sort of publicly shame them and maybe effect some positive change. 

Neil 
So is shame always bad? 

Sam
Well, she does say that too much shame can be crippling and debilitating. Both these words mean that shame is so strong that we really can’t manage the emotion, we can’t deal with it, we can’t do anything to put it right. But she does say that a bit of shame can be positive because it effects change. This means that it causes change. If someone is shamed on social media, it’s very public and can mean that they change their behaviour. 

Neil
I suppose though there is one group  I think have to accept public shaming, and perhaps deserve it more than others. 

Sam
I think I can guess. Would it be politicians, perhaps? These days we are very cynical about politicians, aren’t we? Social media is one area where the public can directly contact and comment on what their representatives are or aren’t doing. 

Neil
But politicians are a particular kind of person, aren’t they? Cultural historian Tiffany Watt-Smith made this comment on the same Woman’s Hour programme. 

Tiffany Watt-Smith
Shame is ... can be very very useful and the idea of someone who doesn’t experience that at all, like a sort of Teflon-coated politician, I mean, that's… that’s a kind of frightening image. 

Neil
What’s she saying here, Sam? 

Sam
She’s talking about how some politicians to do not seem to be bothered by shaming. They just ignore it and move on. She describes them as Teflon coated. This is – aha – a reference to non-stick cookware! Teflon is the brand name of the chemical which was used to make pots and pans non-stick. The pans were coated or covered in this material. The reference to politicians is that there are some to whom criticism and shame just don’t stick. They manage to avoid any negative consequences of their actions and this, she says, is scary. 

Neil
Here’s Tiffany Watt-Smith again. 

Tiffany Watt-Smith
Shame is ... can be very very useful and the idea of someone who doesn’t experience that at all, like a sort of Teflon-coated politician, I mean, that's… that’s a kind of frightening image. 

Neil 
It’s nearly time now to review our vocabulary, but first, let’s have the answer to the quiz question, which was about non-stick coating on cookware, or Teflon, as we heard. When was it invented? 
a) 1930s
b) 1960s or
c) 1980s
What did you think, Sam? 

Sam
I guessed the 1960s as I think it was invented as part of the US space programme. 

Neil
Well, a lot of people think that and, like you, a lot of people are wrong. It was actually discovered, by accident, in 1938. So well done if you got that right but no shame if you didn’t! Now on with today’s words. 

Sam
OK. Yes, we were talking about shame, an uncomfortable feeling of guilt and embarrassment at something we’ve done.

Neil
Shame can be crippling and debilitating. Both these adjectives mean making someone unable to deal with the situation. They can feel so badly about what they have done that they find it difficult to move forward emotionally. 

Sam
We then had to effect change. This means to make change happen. Note this is 'effect' with an 'e' and not 'affect' with an 'a'. 

Neil
Teflon is a non-stick covering for cookware. 

Sam
And something that is coated with something is covered with something. So Teflon coated means covered in Teflon. 

Neil
Well, that’s all for this programme. We’ll be with you again soon, but if you can’t wait, you can find us in all the usual places on social media, online and on our app. Just search for bbclearninglish. Goodbye!

a) 1600s
b) 1700s, or
c) 1800s
What do you think, Rob? 

Rob
I’m going to guess that it’s the 1600s as there have always been very wealthy people. 

Neil
Well, I’ll reveal the answer later. Now, the BBC Money Box programme covers all sorts of financial features. Recently they were talking about lifestyle financial planning, which is planning your finances to meet the kind of lifestyle you want to have. Julie Lord leads a financial planning organisation and she talked about the process of lifestyle financial planning. How many numbers does she say you need to start with? 

Julie Lord
Well, we would start by saying that we need to put together a lifetime cashflow forecast or a model. You just need four numbers: your income, your expenditure, assets, liabilities and then we project forward to show you what sort of lifestyle you will have if you do nothing at all and if indeed you do some of the things that - perhaps an ISA or a pension or any other kind of financial product - might help you with. 

Neil 
So how many numbers do you need? 

Rob
She says that you start with just four numbers. 

Neil
That’s right. The first of these numbers is your income, this is the money that you have coming in, your salary, for example. 

Rob
Then there is the number for your expenditure. This is the money you have going out for rent, food, entertainment, transport and so on. 

Neil
The next number was for assets. This is the cash value of things that you own. For example property, cars, jewellery as well as savings and investments, that kind of thing. 

Rob
And finally there is liabilities. This is the money that you owe, for example on credit cards or loans. 

Neil
So if you know these details, she says they can come up with a lifetime cashflow forecast, which is a calculation of how much money you can expect to have in the future and if that is enough to meet your expectations. Do you have those details? Do you know your numbers, Rob? 

Rob
I have a very detailed spreadsheet where I do list my income and expenditure. So I do know from month to month how much money I need and how much I can spend. 

Neil
That sounds very organised! What does it tell you about your future? 

Rob
Well, it just reminds me of exactly how much money I don’t have. It’s quite depressing! How about you, Neil? 

Neil
Oh, I live in blissful ignorance. I have no idea how big my debts are. I try not to worry about it. I kind of think I’m much too young to worry about it now and that as if by magic it will all work out in the end. So it would be difficult for me to come up those four numbers. Anyway, let’s listen to Julie Lord again describing the lifestyle financial planning process. 

Julie Lord
Well, we would start by saying that we need to put together a lifetime cashflow forecast or a model. You just need four numbers: your income, your expenditure, assets, liabilities and then we project forward to show you what sort of lifestyle you will have if you do nothing at all and if indeed you do some of the things that - perhaps an ISA or a pension or any other kind of financial product - might help you with.

Neil
Is lifestyle financial planning only for older people with a good pension? Not according to Julie Lord. 

Julie Lord
Well, it’s not all about old age, is it? I mean there are people… we have quite a number of younger clients who come to us and say 'we just want to get financially organised, we've heard about all this stuff, these financial products, no idea really what they are or, more importantly, what they’re going to do for us, so can you give us a hand to help us look forward to see what will happen'. 

Neil
So she also has younger clients who ask for her company’s help. 

Rob
Yes, she uses the phrase, give us a hand, which means to help someone. If you give someone a hand, you help them. 

Neil
Exactly, in the way that I give you a hand with 6 Minute English. 

Rob
Well, I think I give you a hand rather than the other way around, Neil. 

Neil
Really, well let’s not fall out about it. Let’s listen to Julie Lord again. 

Julie Lord
Well, it’s not all about old age, is it? I mean, there are people… we have quite a number of younger clients who come to us and say 'we just want to get financially organised, we've heard about all this stuff, these financial products, no idea really what they are or, more importantly, what they’re going to do for us, so can you give us a hand to help us look forward to see what will happen'. 

Neil 
It’s nearly time now to review our vocabulary, but first, let’s have the answer to our quiz question. When was the word millionaire first used in English? Was it:
a) 1600s
b) 1700s, or
c) 1800s
What did you think, Rob? 

Rob
Well, I guessed and said it was the 1600s. 

Neil
Well, not a good guess this time, I’m afraid. It’s actually a lot later. It was the 1800s when it was first used in English, though it had appeared in French in the 1700s. Now on with the vocabulary. 

Rob
Yes, we had a lot of financial terms in this programme. We had cashflow forecast. This is a calculation of how much money you can expect to have at a particular time in the future. 

Neil
And the cashflow forecast is based on knowing your income, which is the money you have coming in and your expenditure, the money you have going out. 

Rob
You also need to know your assets, which is the value of things you own as well as savings and investments. This is balanced against your liabilities, which is the term for the money that you owe, for example on credit cards. 

Neil
And finally we had the expression to give someone a hand meaning to help someone. Well, that’s all from us in this programme. We look forward to your company next time. Until then, you can find us in all the usual places on social media, online and on our app. Just search for bbclearninglish. Bye, and thanks Rob for giving me a hand.

Catherine
Hello. This is 6 Minute English I'm Catherine.

Sam
And I'm Sam.

Catherine
Now Sam, have you been watching the World Cup?

Sam
Cricket or football? Because they are both being played at the moment

Catherine
They are. Now I’m talking about football, the Women’s World Cup.

Sam
In that case, yes, I have. I’ve really enjoyed it and it’s been great that finally we can watch the matches live on TV and that there has been so much interest in the media.

Catherine
We’ll be finding out a little bit more about the history of women’s football in England in today’s programme, but first, Sam, a question for you. When was the first official woman’s football World Cup?

A: 1970

B: 1988, or

C: 1991

What do you think, Sam?

Sam
Well I think I can get this through mathematics rather than knowledge, so I’m not going to say it right now, but I’ll tell you later.

Catherine
OK. Well I will tell you the answer later in the programme. Now, Gemma Clarke is a writer on women’s football in England and she spoke recently on the BBC Woman’s Hour Programme. Here she describes the reaction throughout the years to women’s football. Has it been easy for the women’s game in England?

Gemma Clarke
Women’s football has really been a struggle to play, to have any kind of agency and to be taken seriously as athletes. That can be seen throughout history. I think every moment that women’s football has had, you know there’s been a kind of, a backlash afterwards or a kind of an attempt to keep women back and to dampen enthusiasm for the sport.

Catherine 
So, it’s not been easy, has it?

Sam
No, she said it’s been a struggle, which means it’s been difficult to make any progress.

Catherine
And she also mentioned that there was no agency in the women’s game. To have agency means you have control over your own situation, you can make the decisions you want to make. So she’s saying that the women’s game didn’t really have control over its own future.

Sam
Every time they had some success, there was a backlash, there was a negative reaction to their success.

Catherine
That’s right and she goes on to say that people tried to dampen enthusiasm for the sport. They tried to make it difficult for people to see and enjoy it. So who tried to dampen enthusiasm and how did they do it? Well, during and after the First World War, women’s football became really popular with crowds of up to 50,000 watching games. It may have been popular with the crowds, but it wasn’t so popular with the men who ran the game, the English Football Association. Here’s Gemma Clarke again.

Gemma Clarke
The men’s football association were panicked by seeing women doing so well and they banned all women from playing football on association grounds and that lasted for about 50 years. It was a very concerted effort to keep women’s football at amateur status and ensure that there weren’t crowds watching them play.

Catherine
So the men were really worried by the success of the women’s game. They thought that it might take money and supporters away from the men’s game.

Sam
So they banned woman from playing on their pitches. This means that they no longer allowed them to use the pitches anymore. This effectively killed the professional women’s game as up to then they had been using the same facilities as the men.

Catherine
This she says was a concerted effort to restrict women’s football. When you make a concerted effort to do something it means that you try really hard to do it. I’m pleased to say that the ban on woman using Football Association pitches was eventually lifted, although only comparatively recently, in 1971. Right, before we review today’s vocabulary, let’s have the answer to today’s question. So I asked you, Sam, when was the first official Women’s World Cup? Was it…

A: 1970

B: 1988, or

C: 1991

And you said Sam that you were going to work this out with maths – so come on then.

Sam
I did! So, I know the World Cup is held every four years, it’s 2019 now, so the answer must be an odd year – bear with me - which makes it 1991. Am I right, Catherine?

Catherine
Well we’ll see if that mathematical approach is any better than actually just knowing the answer. The first World Cup for women was actually held in …..

Sam
Come on, hurry up! Let me out of my misery.

Catherine
1970

Sam
I can’t believe I got that wrong

Catherine
But, it wasn’t an official tournament. The first officialwomen’s world cup was indeed 1991. Your maths worked. So well done Sam and everybody else who got that right. Now, before we get to extra time and penalties, let’s recap today’s vocabulary.

Sam
A struggle is how you can describe something that is very difficult to achieve, something you have to fight for.

Catherine
To have agency means being able to act independently and have control over your own choices.

Sam
A backlash is a strong negative reaction to something.

Catherine
If you try to dampen enthusiasm for something, you try to make people less interested in it.

Sam
Banning something means using certain powers to stop something from happening.

Catherine
And finally, making a concerted effort means trying really hard.

Sam
Well the final whistle has blown for us today. We’ll see you again soon and don’t forget to look out for more from the BBC Learning English team online, on social media and on our app. Bye for now.

Neil
Hello and welcome to 6 Minute English. I'm Neil.

Sam
And I'm Sam.

Neil
Now Sam, how would you define eSports?

Sam
eSports? Well this is essentially competitive video gaming. Individuals and teams take part in competitions where they play video games. 

Neil
So just like me and my kids at the weekend?

Sam
Well, no! eSports is enormous. Tens of thousands of people turn up to watch these events. The players are professional and get paid huge salaries – the best ones are millionaires.

Neil
Well, maybe I’m not quite in that league yet! But the business of eSports is our topic for this programme. Before we press 'play' on the subject though, a question. Approximately how much was generated by eSports and video games in the last year? Was it…

a) $130 million?
b) $13 billion?
c) $130 billion?

What do you think then, Sam?

Sam
I’m going to say $130 billion. It’s a huge amount, but I think it’s that successful at the moment.

Neil
OK, we’ll find out if you’re right at the end of the programme. Not so long ago the idea of making a living playing computer games would have seemed impossible. However, times have changed as technology has improved. eSports are even going to be included in the 2022 Asian Games. So it might not be long before they make an appearance at the Olympics. Gabriël Rau is a pro-eSportsman. He was interviewed for the BBC programme In Business. He thinks eSports are going to grow and grow, but does he think that’s a bad thing?

Gabriël Rau, pro-eSportsman
It's becoming more of a normal sports thing with this generation about to have children and moving forward I feel like it might even become a staple. Might become as normal as sports are right now. I don't think it necessarily has to be a bad thing. It is time-consuming though, so I feel like, if you do want to introduce anybody, especially children, into video games, discipline is the way to go.

Neil 
So, is the growth of eSports a bad thing?

Sam
Not, according to Gabriël. He thinks that people having children now have grown up with computer games and these are beginning to be seen in the same way as traditional sports. In fact, he thinks they will become a staple.

Neil
And what does he mean by that?

Sam
Something that is a staple is a basic element, something we expect. For example, in the UK we talk about potatoes being a staple food and football being a staple of the school curriculum.

Neil
But he does mention a disadvantage, doesn't he?

Sam
Yes. He speaks quite quickly but he says that it is time-consuming. It eats up a lot of time!

Neil
Oh yes, I know that from my own experience. I can start playing a game then find that many hours have passed and it’s the middle of the night.

Sam
And that’s why Gabriël goes on to talk about the need for discipline. This is having strict controls and restrictions and importantly sticking to them. So, for example, if you say you are only going to play for an hour every day, you have to stop playing after an hour, even if you want to carry on. That’s discipline.

Neil
And he makes the point that this is important if you are introducing children to video games. Not everyone involved in eSports wants to be a player. It’s now possible to study the business of eSports at university where you can learn how to manage eSports events. These are the thoughts of a student on one of those courses talking about her response to seeing a big eSports event.

Student of eSports studies
When you look at the background of how it all comes together and the people that spend all that time getting into it, for me I would love to put something like that together, not so much to play it but to put that together and create that experience for other people and that was just my main aspiration really.

Neil
So she doesn’t want to play, does she?

Sam
No, she doesn’t. She seems more interested in putting together an event, which means setting up and managing an event for others to take part in. That, she said, was her aspiration, her ambition.

Neil 
Right, before we review the vocabulary, let’s have the answer to our quiz question. Approximately how much was generated by eSports and video games in the last year?

a) $130 million?
b) $13 billion?
c) $130 billion?

What did you say, Sam?

Sam
I thought $130 billion.

Neil
And, for once, you’re right so well done. The actual figure was approximately $137 billion, which was more than the music industry when you include music sales and concerts. Right on now to remind ourselves of some words and phrases from today’s programme.

Sam
Yes, we’ve been looking at eSports, the world of competitive video gaming.

Neil
We heard that it was becoming so normal that it might become a staple, an expected basic activity in the same way sports like football are.

Sam
But be warned, playing video games is very time-consuming. It eats up a lot of time.

Neil
So you need to have discipline. That means you need to have and keep to restrictions such as the length of time you play or the time of day you play. That is particularly important for children.

Sam
If you organise an event, you can say that you put it together.

Neil
And your ambition, your hope for the future is an aspiration.

Sam
And my aspiration is to beat my high score on my favourite game, so are we done now?

Neil
Yes, it’s game over for us today. We’ll see you again soon and don’t forget to look out for more from the bblearningenglish team online, on social media and on our app. Bye for now.


Alice's Adventures in Wonderland

                ALICE'S ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

                          Lewis Carroll

               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 3.0




                            CHAPTER I

                      Down the Rabbit-Hole


  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
on the bank, and of having nothing to do:  once or twice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading, but it had no
pictures or conversations in it, `and what is the use of a book,'
thought Alice `without pictures or conversation?'

  So she was considering in her own mind (as well as she could,
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid), whether
the pleasure of making a daisy-chain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies, when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her.

  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that; nor did Alice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
itself, `Oh dear!  Oh dear!  I shall be late!'  (when she thought
it over afterwards, it occurred to her that she ought to have
wondered at this, but at the time it all seemed quite natural);
but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT-
POCKET, and looked at it, and then hurried on, Alice started to
her feet, for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat-pocket, or a watch to
take out of it, and burning with curiosity, she ran across the
field after it, and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbit-hole under the hedge.

  In another moment down went Alice after it, never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again.

  The rabbit-hole went straight on like a tunnel for some way,
and then dipped suddenly down, so suddenly that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well.

  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look
down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
see anything; then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and book-shelves;
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed; it was
labelled `ORANGE MARMALADE', but to her great disappointment it
was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
fell past it.

  `Well!' thought Alice to herself, `after such a fall as this, I
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave they'll
all think me at home!  Why, I wouldn't say anything about it,
even if I fell off the top of the house!' (Which was very likely
true.)

  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  `I
wonder how many miles I've fallen by this time?' she said aloud.
`I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let
me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think--' (for,
you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over) `--yes,
that's about the right distance--but then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude I've got to?'  (Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
say.)

  Presently she began again.  `I wonder if I shall fall right
THROUGH the earth!  How funny it'll seem to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I
think--' (she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this
time, as it didn't sound at all the right word) `--but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
Please, Ma'am, is this New Zealand or Australia?' (and she tried
to curtsey as she spoke--fancy CURTSEYING as you're falling
through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?)  `And what
an ignorant little girl she'll think me for asking!  No, it'll
never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.'

  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
began talking again.  `Dinah'll miss me very much to-night, I
should think!'  (Dinah was the cat.)  `I hope they'll remember
her saucer of milk at tea-time.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were
down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, I'm afraid, but
you might catch a bat, and that's very like a mouse, you know.
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?'  And here Alice began to get
rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
way, `Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats?' and sometimes, `Do
bats eat cats?' for, you see, as she couldn't answer either
question, it didn't much matter which way she put it.  She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very
earnestly, `Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a
bat?' when suddenly, thump! thump! down she came upon a heap of
sticks and dry leaves, and the fall was over.

  Alice was not a bit hurt, and she jumped up on to her feet in a
moment:  she looked up, but it was all dark overhead; before her
was another long passage, and the White Rabbit was still in
sight, hurrying down it.  There was not a moment to be lost:
away went Alice like the wind, and was just in time to hear it
say, as it turned a corner, `Oh my ears and whiskers, how late
it's getting!'  She was close behind it when she turned the
corner, but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen:  she found
herself in a long, low hall, which was lit up by a row of lamps
hanging from the roof.

  There were doors all round the hall, but they were all locked;
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
other, trying every door, she walked sadly down the middle,
wondering how she was ever to get out again.

  Suddenly she came upon a little three-legged table, all made of
solid glass; there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key,
and Alice's first thought was that it might belong to one of the
doors of the hall; but, alas! either the locks were too large, or
the key was too small, but at any rate it would not open any of
them.  However, on the second time round, she came upon a low
curtain she had not noticed before, and behind it was a little
door about fifteen inches high:  she tried the little golden key
in the lock, and to her great delight it fitted!

  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
passage, not much larger than a rat-hole:  she knelt down and
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw.
How she longed to get out of that dark hall, and wander about
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains, but
she could not even get her head through the doorway; `and even if
my head would go through,' thought poor Alice, `it would be of
very little use without my shoulders.  Oh, how I wish
I could shut up like a telescope!  I think I could, if I only
know how to begin.'  For, you see, so many out-of-the-way things
had happened lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible.

  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door, so she
went back to the table, half hoping she might find another key on
it, or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
telescopes:  this time she found a little bottle on it, (`which
certainly was not here before,' said Alice,) and round the neck
of the bottle was a paper label, with the words `DRINK ME'
beautifully printed on it in large letters.

  It was all very well to say `Drink me,' but the wise little
Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry.  `No, I'll look
first,' she said, `and see whether it's marked "poison" or not';
for she had read several nice little histories about children who
had got burnt, and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
things, all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules
their friends had taught them:  such as, that a red-hot poker
will burn you if you hold it too long; and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a knife, it usually bleeds; and she had
never forgotten that, if you drink much from a bottle marked
`poison,' it is almost certain to disagree with you, sooner or
later.

  However, this bottle was NOT marked `poison,' so Alice ventured
to taste it, and finding it very nice, (it had, in fact, a sort
of mixed flavour of cherry-tart, custard, pine-apple, roast
turkey, toffee, and hot buttered toast,) she very soon finished
it off.

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

         *       *       *       *       *       *

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  `What a curious feeling!' said Alice; `I must be shutting up
like a telescope.'

  And so it was indeed:  she was now only ten inches high, and
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
size for going through the little door into that lovely garden.
First, however, she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
going to shrink any further:  she felt a little nervous about
this; `for it might end, you know,' said Alice to herself, `in my
going out altogether, like a candle.  I wonder what I should be
like then?'  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
like after the candle is blown out, for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing.

  After a while, finding that nothing more happened, she decided
on going into the garden at once; but, alas for poor Alice!
when she got to the door, she found she had forgotten the
little golden key, and when she went back to the table for it,
she found she could not possibly reach it:  she could see it
quite plainly through the glass, and she tried her best to climb
up one of the legs of the table, but it was too slippery;
and when she had tired herself out with trying,
the poor little thing sat down and cried.

  `Come, there's no use in crying like that!' said Alice to
herself, rather sharply; `I advise you to leave off this minute!'
She generally gave herself very good advice, (though she very
seldom followed it), and sometimes she scolded herself so
severely as to bring tears into her eyes; and once she remembered
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
of croquet she was playing against herself, for this curious
child was very fond of pretending to be two people.  `But it's no
use now,' thought poor Alice, `to pretend to be two people!  Why,
there's hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
person!'

  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
the table:  she opened it, and found in it a very small cake, on
which the words `EAT ME' were beautifully marked in currants.
`Well, I'll eat it,' said Alice, `and if it makes me grow larger,
I can reach the key; and if it makes me grow smaller, I can creep
under the door; so either way I'll get into the garden, and I
don't care which happens!'

  She ate a little bit, and said anxiously to herself, `Which
way?  Which way?', holding her hand on the top of her head to
feel which way it was growing, and she was quite surprised to
find that she remained the same size:  to be sure, this generally
happens when one eats cake, but Alice had got so much into the
way of expecting nothing but out-of-the-way things to happen,
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
common way.

  So she set to work, and very soon finished off the cake.

                           CHAPTER II

                        The Pool of Tears


  `Curiouser and curiouser!' cried Alice (she was so much
surprised, that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
English); `now I'm opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was!  Good-bye, feet!' (for when she looked down at her
feet, they seemed to be almost out of sight, they were getting so
far off).  `Oh, my poor little feet, I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now, dears?  I'm sure _I_ shan't
be able!  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
about you:  you must manage the best way you can; --but I must be
kind to them,' thought Alice, `or perhaps they won't walk the
way I want to go!  Let me see:  I'll give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas.'

  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it.
`They must go by the carrier,' she thought; `and how funny it'll
seem, sending presents to one's own feet!  And how odd the
directions will look!

            ALICE'S RIGHT FOOT, ESQ.
                HEARTHRUG,
                    NEAR THE FENDER,
                        (WITH ALICE'S LOVE).

Oh dear, what nonsense I'm talking!'

  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall:  in
fact she was now more than nine feet high, and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door.

  Poor Alice!  It was as much as she could do, lying down on one
side, to look through into the garden with one eye; but to get
through was more hopeless than ever:  she sat down and began to
cry again.

  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself,' said Alice, `a great
girl like you,' (she might well say this), `to go on crying in
this way!  Stop this moment, I tell you!'  But she went on all
the same, shedding gallons of tears, until there was a large pool
all round her, about four inches deep and reaching half down the
hall.

  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the
distance, and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming.
It was the White Rabbit returning, splendidly dressed, with a
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
other:  he came trotting along in a great hurry, muttering to
himself as he came, `Oh! the Duchess, the Duchess! Oh! won't she
be savage if I've kept her waiting!'  Alice felt so desperate
that she was ready to ask help of any one; so, when the Rabbit
came near her, she began, in a low, timid voice, `If you please,
sir--'  The Rabbit started violently, dropped the white kid
gloves and the fan, and skurried away into the darkness as hard
as he could go.

  Alice took up the fan and gloves, and, as the hall was very
hot, she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking:
`Dear, dear!  How queer everything is to-day!  And yesterday
things went on just as usual.  I wonder if I've been changed in
the night?  Let me think:  was I the same when I got up this
morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different.  But if I'm not the same, the next question is, Who in
the world am I?  Ah, THAT'S the great puzzle!'  And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of
them.

  `I'm sure I'm not Ada,' she said, `for her hair goes in such
long ringlets, and mine doesn't go in ringlets at all; and I'm
sure I can't be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHE'S she, and I'm I,
and--oh dear, how puzzling it all is!  I'll try if I know all the
things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,
and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven is--oh dear!
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the
Multiplication Table doesn't signify:  let's try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,
and Rome--no, THAT'S all wrong, I'm certain!  I must have been
changed for Mabel!  I'll try and say "How doth the little--"'
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,
and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and
strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:--

            `How doth the little crocodile
              Improve his shining tail,
            And pour the waters of the Nile
              On every golden scale!

            `How cheerfully he seems to grin,
              How neatly spread his claws,
            And welcome little fishes in
              With gently smiling jaws!'

  `I'm sure those are not the right words,' said poor Alice, and
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, `I must be Mabel
after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so
many lessons to learn!  No, I've made up my mind about it; if I'm
Mabel, I'll stay down here!  It'll be no use their putting their
heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only look
up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I
like being that person, I'll come up:  if not, I'll stay down
here till I'm somebody else"--but, oh dear!' cried Alice, with a
sudden burst of tears, `I do wish they WOULD put their heads
down!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!'

  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was
surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbit's little
white kid gloves while she was talking.  `How CAN I have done
that?' she thought.  `I must be growing small again.'  She got up
and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,
as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,
and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the
cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it
hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

`That WAS a narrow escape!' said Alice, a good deal frightened at
the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
existence; `and now for the garden!' and she ran with all speed
back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut
again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
before, `and things are worse than ever,' thought the poor child,
`for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare
it's too bad, that it is!'

  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  Her first
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, `and in that
case I can go back by railway,' she said to herself.  (Alice had
been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general
conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in
the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
behind them a railway station.)  However, she soon made out that
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
feet high.

  `I wish I hadn't cried so much!' said Alice, as she swam about,
trying to find her way out.  `I shall be punished for it now, I
suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer
thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer to-day.'

  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a
little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then
she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

  `Would it be of any use, now,' thought Alice, `to speak to this
mouse?  Everything is so out-of-the-way down here, that I should
think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, there's no harm in
trying.'  So she began:  `O Mouse, do you know the way out of
this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!'
(Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:
she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having
seen in her brother's Latin Grammar, `A mouse--of a mouse--to a
mouse--a mouse--O mouse!')  The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
eyes, but it said nothing.

  `Perhaps it doesn't understand English,' thought Alice; `I
daresay it's a French mouse, come over with William the
Conqueror.'  (For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.)  So she
began again:  `Ou est ma chatte?' which was the first sentence in
her French lesson-book.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  `Oh, I beg
your pardon!' cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the
poor animal's feelings.  `I quite forgot you didn't like cats.'

  `Not like cats!' cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate
voice.  `Would YOU like cats if you were me?'

  `Well, perhaps not,' said Alice in a soothing tone:  `don't be
angry about it.  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah:
I think you'd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her.
She is such a dear quiet thing,' Alice went on, half to herself,
as she swam lazily about in the pool, `and she sits purring so
nicely by the fire, licking her paws and washing her face--and
she is such a nice soft thing to nurse--and she's such a capital
one for catching mice--oh, I beg your pardon!' cried Alice again,
for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
certain it must be really offended.  `We won't talk about her any
more if you'd rather not.'

  `We indeed!' cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end
of his tail.  `As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family
always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Don't let me hear
the name again!'

  `I won't indeed!' said Alice, in a great hurry to change the
subject of conversation.  `Are you--are you fond--of--of dogs?'
The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  `There is
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
A little bright-eyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly
brown hair!  And it'll fetch things when you throw them, and
it'll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of things--I
can't remember half of them--and it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says it's so useful, it's worth a hundred pounds!
He says it kills all the rats and--oh dear!' cried Alice in a
sorrowful tone, `I'm afraid I've offended it again!'  For the
Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

  So she called softly after it, `Mouse dear!  Do come back
again, and we won't talk about cats or dogs either, if you don't
like them!'  When the Mouse heard this, it turned round and swam
slowly back to her:  its face was quite pale (with passion, Alice
thought), and it said in a low trembling voice, `Let us get to
the shore, and then I'll tell you my history, and you'll
understand why it is I hate cats and dogs.'

  It was high time to go, for the pool was getting quite crowded
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it:  there were a
Duck and a Dodo, a Lory and an Eaglet, and several other curious
creatures.  Alice led the way, and the whole party swam to the
shore.



                           CHAPTER III

                  A Caucus-Race and a Long Tale


  They were indeed a queer-looking party that assembled on the
bank--the birds with draggled feathers, the animals with their
fur clinging close to them, and all dripping wet, cross, and
uncomfortable.

  The first question of course was, how to get dry again:  they
had a consultation about this, and after a few minutes it seemed
quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with
them, as if she had known them all her life.  Indeed, she had
quite a long argument with the Lory, who at last turned sulky,
and would only say, `I am older than you, and must know better';
and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was,
and, as the Lory positively refused to tell its age, there was no
more to be said.

  At last the Mouse, who seemed to be a person of authority among
them, called out, `Sit down, all of you, and listen to me!  I'LL
soon make you dry enough!'  They all sat down at once, in a large
ring, with the Mouse in the middle.  Alice kept her eyes
anxiously fixed on it, for she felt sure she would catch a bad
cold if she did not get dry very soon.

  `Ahem!' said the Mouse with an important air, `are you all ready?
This is the driest thing I know.  Silence all round, if you please!
"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and
Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria--"'

  `Ugh!' said the Lory, with a shiver.

  `I beg your pardon!' said the Mouse, frowning, but very
politely:  `Did you speak?'

  `Not I!' said the Lory hastily.

  `I thought you did,' said the Mouse.  `--I proceed.  "Edwin and
Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:
and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found
it advisable--"'

  `Found WHAT?' said the Duck.

  `Found IT,' the Mouse replied rather crossly:  `of course you
know what "it" means.'

  `I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing,' said
the Duck:  `it's generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,
what did the archbishop find?'

  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,
`"--found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William
and offer him the crown.  William's conduct at first was
moderate.  But the insolence of his Normans--"  How are you
getting on now, my dear?' it continued, turning to Alice as it
spoke.

  `As wet as ever,' said Alice in a melancholy tone:  `it doesn't
seem to dry me at all.'

  `In that case,' said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, `I
move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies--'

  `Speak English!' said the Eaglet.  `I don't know the meaning of
half those long words, and, what's more, I don't believe you do
either!'  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:
some of the other birds tittered audibly.

  `What I was going to say,' said the Dodo in an offended tone,
`was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucus-race.'

  `What IS a Caucus-race?' said Alice; not that she wanted much
to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

  `Why,' said the Dodo, `the best way to explain it is to do it.'
(And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter
day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.)

  First it marked out a race-course, in a sort of circle, (`the
exact shape doesn't matter,' it said,) and then all the party
were placed along the course, here and there.  There was no `One,
two, three, and away,' but they began running when they liked,
and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know
when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half
an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called
out `The race is over!' and they all crowded round it, panting,
and asking, `But who has won?'

  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead (the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
in the pictures of him), while the rest waited in silence.  At
last the Dodo said, `EVERYBODY has won, and all must have
prizes.'

  `But who is to give the prizes?' quite a chorus of voices
asked.

  `Why, SHE, of course,' said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with
one finger; and the whole party at once crowded round her,
calling out in a confused way, `Prizes! Prizes!'

  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt
water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes.
There was exactly one a-piece all round.

  `But she must have a prize herself, you know,' said the Mouse.

  `Of course,' the Dodo replied very gravely.  `What else have
you got in your pocket?' he went on, turning to Alice.

  `Only a thimble,' said Alice sadly.

  `Hand it over here,' said the Dodo.

  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble, saying `We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble'; and, when it had finished this short
speech, they all cheered.

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh; and, as she could not
think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,
looking as solemn as she could.

  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise
and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again
in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

  `You promised to tell me your history, you know,' said Alice,
`and why it is you hate--C and D,' she added in a whisper, half
afraid that it would be offended again.

  `Mine is a long and a sad tale!' said the Mouse, turning to
Alice, and sighing.

  `It IS a long tail, certainly,' said Alice, looking down with
wonder at the Mouse's tail; `but why do you call it sad?'  And
she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so
that her idea of the tale was something like this:--

                    `Fury said to a
                   mouse, That he
                 met in the
               house,
            "Let us
              both go to
                law:  I will
                  prosecute
                    YOU.  --Come,
                       I'll take no
                        denial; We
                     must have a
                 trial:  For
              really this
           morning I've
          nothing
         to do."
           Said the
             mouse to the
               cur, "Such
                 a trial,
                   dear Sir,
                         With
                     no jury
                  or judge,
                would be
              wasting
             our
              breath."
               "I'll be
                 judge, I'll
                   be jury,"
                         Said
                    cunning
                      old Fury:
                     "I'll
                      try the
                         whole
                          cause,
                             and
                        condemn
                       you
                      to
                       death."'


  `You are not attending!' said the Mouse to Alice severely.
`What are you thinking of?'

  `I beg your pardon,' said Alice very humbly:  `you had got to
the fifth bend, I think?'

  `I had NOT!' cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

  `A knot!' said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
looking anxiously about her.  `Oh, do let me help to undo it!'

  `I shall do nothing of the sort,' said the Mouse, getting up
and walking away.  `You insult me by talking such nonsense!'

  `I didn't mean it!' pleaded poor Alice.  `But you're so easily
offended, you know!'

  The Mouse only growled in reply.

  `Please come back and finish your story!' Alice called after
it; and the others all joined in chorus, `Yes, please do!' but
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
quicker.

  `What a pity it wouldn't stay!' sighed the Lory, as soon as it
was quite out of sight; and an old Crab took the opportunity of
saying to her daughter `Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you
never to lose YOUR temper!'  `Hold your tongue, Ma!' said the
young Crab, a little snappishly.  `You're enough to try the
patience of an oyster!'

  `I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do!' said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular.  `She'd soon fetch it back!'

  `And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?'
said the Lory.

  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about
her pet:  `Dinah's our cat.  And she's such a capital one for
catching mice you can't think!  And oh, I wish you could see her
after the birds!  Why, she'll eat a little bird as soon as look
at it!'

  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one old Magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, `I really must be
getting home; the night-air doesn't suit my throat!' and a Canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children, `Come away, my
dears!  It's high time you were all in bed!'  On various pretexts
they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

  `I wish I hadn't mentioned Dinah!' she said to herself in a
melancholy tone.  `Nobody seems to like her, down here, and I'm
sure she's the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I
wonder if I shall ever see you any more!'  And here poor Alice
began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and low-spirited.
In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping
that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to
finish his story.



                           CHAPTER IV

                The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and
looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something;
and she heard it muttering to itself `The Duchess!  The Duchess!
Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  She'll get me
executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have
dropped them, I wonder?'  Alice guessed in a moment that it was
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she
very good-naturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seen--everything seemed to have changed since her
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
the little door, had vanished completely.

  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,
and called out to her in an angry tone, `Why, Mary Ann, what ARE
you doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of
gloves and a fan!  Quick, now!'  And Alice was so much frightened
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without
trying to explain the mistake it had made.

  `He took me for his housemaid,' she said to herself as she ran.
`How surprised he'll be when he finds out who I am!  But I'd
better take him his fan and gloves--that is, if I can find them.'
As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door
of which was a bright brass plate with the name `W. RABBIT'
engraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried
upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
gloves.

  `How queer it seems,' Alice said to herself, `to be going
messages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinah'll be sending me on
messages next!'  And she began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen:  `"Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready
for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse!  But I've got to see
that the mouse doesn't get out."  Only I don't think,' Alice went
on, `that they'd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
people about like that!'

  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with
a table in the window, and on it (as she had hoped) a fan and two
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and
a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking-
glass.  There was no label this time with the words `DRINK ME,'
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  `I know
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen,' she said to herself,
`whenever I eat or drink anything; so I'll just see what this
bottle does.  I do hope it'll make me grow large again, for
really I'm quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!'

  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:
before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing
against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself
`That's quite enough--I hope I shan't grow any more--As it is, I
can't get out at the door--I do wish I hadn't drunk quite so
much!'

  Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and
growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in
another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the
other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,
as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one
foot up the chimney, and said to herself `Now I can do no more,
whatever happens.  What WILL become of me?'

  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,
and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

  `It was much pleasanter at home,' thought poor Alice, `when one
wasn't always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadn't gone down that
rabbit-hole--and yet--and yet--it's rather curious, you know,
this sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
When I used to read fairy-tales, I fancied that kind of thing
never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There
ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when
I grow up, I'll write one--but I'm grown up now,' she added in a
sorrowful tone; `at least there's no room to grow up any more
HERE.'

  `But then,' thought Alice, `shall I NEVER get any older than I
am now?  That'll be a comfort, one way--never to be an old woman--
but then--always to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldn't like THAT!'

  `Oh, you foolish Alice!' she answered herself.  `How can you
learn lessons in here?  Why, there's hardly room for YOU, and no
room at all for any lesson-books!'

  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,
and making quite a conversation of it altogether; but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

  `Mary Ann!  Mary Ann!' said the voice.  `Fetch me my gloves
this moment!'  Then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairs.  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her, and
she trembled till she shook the house, quite forgetting that she
was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit, and had no
reason to be afraid of it.

  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door, and tried to open it;
but, as the door opened inwards, and Alice's elbow was pressed
hard against it, that attempt proved a failure.  Alice heard it
say to itself `Then I'll go round and get in at the window.'

  `THAT you won't' thought Alice, and, after waiting till she
fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window, she suddenly
spread out her hand, and made a snatch in the air.  She did not
get hold of anything, but she heard a little shriek and a fall,
and a crash of broken glass, from which she concluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumber-frame, or something
of the sort.

  Next came an angry voice--the Rabbit's--`Pat! Pat!  Where are
you?'  And then a voice she had never heard before, `Sure then
I'm here!  Digging for apples, yer honour!'

  `Digging for apples, indeed!' said the Rabbit angrily.  `Here!
Come and help me out of THIS!'  (Sounds of more broken glass.)

  `Now tell me, Pat, what's that in the window?'

  `Sure, it's an arm, yer honour!'  (He pronounced it `arrum.')

  `An arm, you goose!   Who ever saw one that size?  Why, it
fills the whole window!'

  `Sure, it does, yer honour:  but it's an arm for all that.'

  `Well, it's got no business there, at any rate:  go and take it
away!'

  There was a long silence after this, and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then; such as, `Sure, I don't like it, yer
honour, at all, at all!'  `Do as I tell you, you coward!' and at
last she spread out her hand again, and made another snatch in
the air.  This time there were TWO little shrieks, and more
sounds of broken glass.  `What a number of cucumber-frames there
must be!' thought Alice.  `I wonder what they'll do next!  As for
pulling me out of the window, I only wish they COULD!  I'm sure I
don't want to stay in here any longer!'

  She waited for some time without hearing anything more:  at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels, and the sound of a
good many voices all talking together:  she made out the words:
`Where's the other ladder?--Why, I hadn't to bring but one;
Bill's got the other--Bill! fetch it here, lad!--Here, put 'em up
at this corner--No, tie 'em together first--they don't reach half
high enough yet--Oh! they'll do well enough; don't be particular--
Here, Bill! catch hold of this rope--Will the roof bear?--Mind
that loose slate--Oh, it's coming down!  Heads below!' (a loud
crash)--`Now, who did that?--It was Bill, I fancy--Who's to go
down the chimney?--Nay, I shan't! YOU do it!--That I won't,
then!--Bill's to go down--Here, Bill! the master says you're to
go down the chimney!'

  `Oh! So Bill's got to come down the chimney, has he?' said
Alice to herself.  `Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
I wouldn't be in Bill's place for a good deal:  this fireplace is
narrow, to be sure; but I THINK I can kick a little!'

  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and
waited till she heard a little animal (she couldn't guess of what
sort it was) scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her:  then, saying to herself `This is Bill,' she gave one
sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.

  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of `There goes
Bill!' then the Rabbit's voice along--`Catch him, you by the
hedge!' then silence, and then another confusion of voices--`Hold
up his head--Brandy now--Don't choke him--How was it, old fellow?
What happened to you?  Tell us all about it!'

  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, (`That's Bill,'
thought Alice,) `Well, I hardly know--No more, thank ye; I'm
better now--but I'm a deal too flustered to tell you--all I know
is, something comes at me like a Jack-in-the-box, and up I goes
like a sky-rocket!'

  `So you did, old fellow!' said the others.

  `We must burn the house down!' said the Rabbit's voice; and
Alice called out as loud as she could, `If you do.  I'll set
Dinah at you!'

  There was a dead silence instantly, and Alice thought to
herself, `I wonder what they WILL do next!  If they had any
sense, they'd take the roof off.'  After a minute or two, they
began moving about again, and Alice heard the Rabbit say, `A
barrowful will do, to begin with.'

  `A barrowful of WHAT?' thought Alice; but she had not long to
doubt, for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at the window, and some of them hit her in the face.
`I'll put a stop to this,' she said to herself, and shouted out,
`You'd better not do that again!' which produced another dead
silence.

  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor, and a bright
idea came into her head.  `If I eat one of these cakes,' she
thought, `it's sure to make SOME change in my size; and as it
can't possibly make me larger, it must make me smaller, I
suppose.'

  So she swallowed one of the cakes, and was delighted to find
that she began shrinking directly.  As soon as she was small
enough to get through the door, she ran out of the house, and
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside.
The poor little Lizard, Bill, was in the middle, being held up by
two guinea-pigs, who were giving it something out of a bottle.
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared; but she
ran off as hard as she could, and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood.

  `The first thing I've got to do,' said Alice to herself, as she
wandered about in the wood, `is to grow to my right size again;
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden.
I think that will be the best plan.'

  It sounded an excellent plan, no doubt, and very neatly and
simply arranged; the only difficulty was, that she had not the
smallest idea how to set about it; and while she was peering
about anxiously among the trees, a little sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in a great hurry.

  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
eyes, and feebly stretching out one paw, trying to touch her.
`Poor little thing!' said Alice, in a coaxing tone, and she tried
hard to whistle to it; but she was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry, in which case it
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing.

  Hardly knowing what she did, she picked up a little bit of
stick, and held it out to the puppy; whereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp of delight,
and rushed at the stick, and made believe to worry it; then Alice
dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run
over; and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy
made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it; then Alice, thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a cart-horse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle
again; then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat
down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape;
so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out
of breath, and till the puppy's bark sounded quite faint in the
distance.

  `And yet what a dear little puppy it was!' said Alice, as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself
with one of the leaves:  `I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much, if--if I'd only been the right size to do it!  Oh
dear!  I'd nearly forgotten that I've got to grow up again!  Let
me see--how IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other; but the great question is, what?'

  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,
about the same height as herself; and when she had looked under
it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.

  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom, and her eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar, that was sitting on the top with its arms folded,
quietly smoking a long hookah, and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else.



                            CHAPTER V

                    Advice from a Caterpillar


  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence:  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth, and addressed her in a languid, sleepy voice.

  `Who are YOU?' said the Caterpillar.

  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation.  Alice
replied, rather shyly, `I--I hardly know, sir, just at present--
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning, but I think
I must have been changed several times since then.'

  `What do you mean by that?' said the Caterpillar sternly.
`Explain yourself!'

  `I can't explain MYSELF, I'm afraid, sir' said Alice, `because
I'm not myself, you see.'

  `I don't see,' said the Caterpillar.

  `I'm afraid I can't put it more clearly,' Alice replied very
politely, `for I can't understand it myself to begin with; and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing.'

  `It isn't,' said the Caterpillar.

  `Well, perhaps you haven't found it so yet,' said Alice; `but
when you have to turn into a chrysalis--you will some day, you
know--and then after that into a butterfly, I should think you'll
feel it a little queer, won't you?'

  `Not a bit,' said the Caterpillar.

  `Well, perhaps your feelings may be different,' said Alice;
`all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.'

  `You!' said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  `Who are YOU?'

  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillar's
making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,
very gravely, `I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.'

  `Why?' said the Caterpillar.

  Here was another puzzling question; and as Alice could not
think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.

  `Come back!' the Caterpillar called after her.  `I've something
important to say!'

  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back
again.

  `Keep your temper,' said the Caterpillar.

  `Is that all?' said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as
she could.

  `No,' said the Caterpillar.

  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else
to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but
at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
again, and said, `So you think you're changed, do you?'

  `I'm afraid I am, sir,' said Alice; `I can't remember things as
I used--and I don't keep the same size for ten minutes together!'

  `Can't remember WHAT things?' said the Caterpillar.

  `Well, I've tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it
all came different!' Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

  `Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM,"' said the Caterpillar.

  Alice folded her hands, and began:--

    `You are old, Father William,' the young man said,
      `And your hair has become very white;
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head--
      Do you think, at your age, it is right?'

    `In my youth,' Father William replied to his son,
      `I feared it might injure the brain;
    But, now that I'm perfectly sure I have none,
      Why, I do it again and again.'

    `You are old,' said the youth, `as I mentioned before,
      And have grown most uncommonly fat;
    Yet you turned a back-somersault in at the door--
      Pray, what is the reason of that?'

    `In my youth,' said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
      `I kept all my limbs very supple
    By the use of this ointment--one shilling the box--
      Allow me to sell you a couple?'

    `You are old,' said the youth, `and your jaws are too weak
      For anything tougher than suet;
    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak--
      Pray how did you manage to do it?'

    `In my youth,' said his father, `I took to the law,
      And argued each case with my wife;
    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
      Has lasted the rest of my life.'

    `You are old,' said the youth, `one would hardly suppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever;
    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose--
      What made you so awfully clever?'

    `I have answered three questions, and that is enough,'
      Said his father; `don't give yourself airs!
    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
      Be off, or I'll kick you down stairs!'


  `That is not said right,' said the Caterpillar.

  `Not QUITE right, I'm afraid,' said Alice, timidly; `some of the
words have got altered.'

  `It is wrong from beginning to end,' said the Caterpillar
decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.

  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

  `What size do you want to be?' it asked.

  `Oh, I'm not particular as to size,' Alice hastily replied;
`only one doesn't like changing so often, you know.'

  `I DON'T know,' said the Caterpillar.

  Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in
her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

  `Are you content now?' said the Caterpillar.

  `Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you
wouldn't mind,' said Alice:  `three inches is such a wretched
height to be.'

  `It is a very good height indeed!' said the Caterpillar
angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke (it was exactly three
inches high).

  `But I'm not used to it!' pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
And she thought of herself, `I wish the creatures wouldn't be so
easily offended!'

  `You'll get used to it in time,' said the Caterpillar; and it
put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got
down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely
remarking as it went, `One side will make you grow taller, and
the other side will make you grow shorter.'

  `One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT?' thought Alice to
herself.

  `Of the mushroom,' said the Caterpillar, just as if she had
asked it aloud; and in another moment it was out of sight.

  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it; and as
it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.
However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.

  `And now which is which?' she said to herself, and nibbled a
little of the right-hand bit to try the effect:  the next moment
she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her
foot!

  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but
she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking
rapidly; so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was
hardly room to open her mouth; but she did it at last, and
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.


     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

         *       *       *       *       *       *

     *       *       *       *       *       *       *

  `Come, my head's free at last!' said Alice in a tone of
delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could
see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
far below her.

  `What CAN all that green stuff be?' said Alice.  `And where
HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I
can't see you?'  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no
result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the
distant green leaves.

  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted
to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,
like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating
her violently with its wings.

  `Serpent!' screamed the Pigeon.

  `I'm NOT a serpent!' said Alice indignantly.  `Let me alone!'

  `Serpent, I say again!' repeated the Pigeon, but in a more
subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, `I've tried every
way, and nothing seems to suit them!'

  `I haven't the least idea what you're talking about,' said
Alice.

  `I've tried the roots of trees, and I've tried banks, and I've
tried hedges,' the Pigeon went on, without attending to her; `but
those serpents!  There's no pleasing them!'

  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

  `As if it wasn't trouble enough hatching the eggs,' said the
Pigeon; `but I must be on the look-out for serpents night and
day!  Why, I haven't had a wink of sleep these three weeks!'

  `I'm very sorry you've been annoyed,' said Alice, who was
beginning to see its meaning.

  `And just as I'd taken the highest tree in the wood,' continued
the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, `and just as I was
thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come
wriggling down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!'

  `But I'm NOT a serpent, I tell you!' said Alice.  `I'm a--I'm
a--'

  `Well!  WHAT are you?' said the Pigeon.  `I can see you're
trying to invent something!'

  `I--I'm a little girl,' said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.

  `A likely story indeed!' said the Pigeon in a tone of the
deepest contempt.  `I've seen a good many little girls in my
time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  You're a
serpent; and there's no use denying it.  I suppose you'll be
telling me next that you never tasted an egg!'

  `I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly,' said Alice, who was a very
truthful child; `but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
serpents do, you know.'

  `I don't believe it,' said the Pigeon; `but if they do, why
then they're a kind of serpent, that's all I can say.'

  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent
for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
adding, `You're looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough; and
what does it matter to me whether you're a little girl or a
serpent?'

  `It matters a good deal to ME,' said Alice hastily; `but I'm
not looking for eggs, as it happens; and if I was, I shouldn't
want YOURS:  I don't like them raw.'

  `Well, be off, then!' said the Pigeon in a sulky tone, as it
settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the
trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and
untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the
pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very
carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,
that it felt quite strange at first; but she got used to it in a
few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  `Come,
there's half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes
are!  I'm never sure what I'm going to be, from one minute to
another!  However, I've got back to my right size:  the next
thing is, to get into that beautiful garden--how IS that to be
done, I wonder?'  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an
open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
`Whoever lives there,' thought Alice, `it'll never do to come
upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their
wits!'  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did
not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
down to nine inches high.



                           CHAPTER VI

                         Pig and Pepper


  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and
wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
running out of the wood--(she considered him to be a footman
because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only,
she would have called him a fish)--and rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,
with a round face, and large eyes like a frog; and both footmen,
Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their
heads.  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and
crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

  The Fish-Footman began by producing from under his arm a great
letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to
the other, saying, in a solemn tone, `For the Duchess.  An
invitation from the Queen to play croquet.'  The Frog-Footman
repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the
words a little, `From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess
to play croquet.'

  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled
together.

  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into
the wood for fear of their hearing her; and when she next peeped
out the Fish-Footman was gone, and the other was sitting on the
ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

  `There's no sort of use in knocking,' said the Footman, `and
that for two reasons.  First, because I'm on the same side of the
door as you are; secondly, because they're making such a noise
inside, no one could possibly hear you.'  And certainly there was
a most extraordinary noise going on within--a constant howling
and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish
or kettle had been broken to pieces.

  `Please, then,' said Alice, `how am I to get in?'

  `There might be some sense in your knocking,' the Footman went
on without attending to her, `if we had the door between us.  For
instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let
you out, you know.'  He was looking up into the sky all the time
he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  `But
perhaps he can't help it,' she said to herself; `his eyes are so
VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might
answer questions.--How am I to get in?' she repeated, aloud.

  `I shall sit here,' the Footman remarked, `till tomorrow--'

  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate
came skimming out, straight at the Footman's head:  it just
grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees
behind him.

  `--or next day, maybe,' the Footman continued in the same tone,
exactly as if nothing had happened.

  `How am I to get in?' asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

  `ARE you to get in at all?' said the Footman.  `That's the
first question, you know.'

  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.
`It's really dreadful,' she muttered to herself, `the way all the
creatures argue.  It's enough to drive one crazy!'

  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
repeating his remark, with variations.  `I shall sit here,' he
said, `on and off, for days and days.'

  `But what am I to do?' said Alice.

  `Anything you like,' said the Footman, and began whistling.

  `Oh, there's no use in talking to him,' said Alice desperately:
`he's perfectly idiotic!'  And she opened the door and went in.

  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of
smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a
three-legged stool in the middle, nursing a baby; the cook was
leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
be full of soup.

  `There's certainly too much pepper in that soup!' Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

  There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the
Duchess sneezed occasionally; and as for the baby, it was
sneezing and howling alternately without a moment's pause.  The
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,
and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from
ear to ear.

  `Please would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, for
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
speak first, `why your cat grins like that?'

  `It's a Cheshire cat,' said the Duchess, `and that's why.  Pig!'

  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
quite jumped; but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on
again:--

  `I didn't know that Cheshire cats always grinned; in fact, I
didn't know that cats COULD grin.'

  `They all can,' said the Duchess; `and most of 'em do.'

  `I don't know of any that do,' Alice said very politely,
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.

  `You don't know much,' said the Duchess; `and that's a fact.'

  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took
the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work
throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby
--the fire-irons came first; then followed a shower of saucepans,
plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when
they hit her; and the baby was howling so much already, that it
was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

  `Oh, PLEASE mind what you're doing!' cried Alice, jumping up
and down in an agony of terror.  `Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS
nose'; as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very
nearly carried it off.

  `If everybody minded their own business,' the Duchess said in a
hoarse growl, `the world would go round a deal faster than it
does.'

  `Which would NOT be an advantage,' said Alice, who felt very
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her
knowledge.  `Just think of what work it would make with the day
and night!  You see the earth takes twenty-four hours to turn
round on its axis--'

  `Talking of axes,' said the Duchess, `chop off her head!'

  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant
to take the hint; but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and
seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  `Twenty-four
hours, I THINK; or is it twelve?  I--'

  `Oh, don't bother ME,' said the Duchess; `I never could abide
figures!'  And with that she began nursing her child again,
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a
violent shake at the end of every line:

        `Speak roughly to your little boy,
          And beat him when he sneezes:
        He only does it to annoy,
          Because he knows it teases.'

                    CHORUS.

    (In which the cook and the baby joined):--

                `Wow! wow! wow!'

  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept
tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing
howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:--

        `I speak severely to my boy,
          I beat him when he sneezes;
        For he can thoroughly enjoy
          The pepper when he pleases!'

                    CHORUS.

                `Wow! wow! wow!'

  `Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like!' the Duchess said
to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  `I must go and
get ready to play croquet with the Queen,' and she hurried out of
the room.  The cook threw a frying-pan after her as she went out,
but it just missed her.

  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer-
shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all
directions, `just like a star-fish,' thought Alice.  The poor
little thing was snorting like a steam-engine when she caught it,
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,
so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much
as she could do to hold it.

  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,
(which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep
tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its
undoing itself,) she carried it out into the open air.  `IF I
don't take this child away with me,' thought Alice, `they're sure
to kill it in a day or two:  wouldn't it be murder to leave it
behind?'  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing
grunted in reply (it had left off sneezing by this time).  `Don't
grunt,' said Alice; `that's not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself.'

  The baby grunted again, and Alice looked very anxiously into
its face to see what was the matter with it.  There could be no
doubt that it had a VERY turn-up nose, much more like a snout
than a real nose; also its eyes were getting extremely small for
a baby:  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at
all.  `But perhaps it was only sobbing,' she thought, and looked
into its eyes again, to see if there were any tears.

  No, there were no tears.  `If you're going to turn into a pig,
my dear,' said Alice, seriously, `I'll have nothing more to do
with you.  Mind now!'  The poor little thing sobbed again (or
grunted, it was impossible to say which), and they went on for
some while in silence.

  Alice was just beginning to think to herself, `Now, what am I
to do with this creature when I get it home?' when it grunted
again, so violently, that she looked down into its face in some
alarm.  This time there could be NO mistake about it:  it was
neither more nor less than a pig, and she felt that it would be
quite absurd for her to carry it further.

  So she set the little creature down, and felt quite relieved to
see it trot away quietly into the wood.  `If it had grown up,'
she said to herself, `it would have made a dreadfully ugly child:
but it makes rather a handsome pig, I think.'  And she began
thinking over other children she knew, who might do very well as
pigs, and was just saying to herself, `if one only knew the right
way to change them--' when she was a little startled by seeing
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off.

  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice.  It looked good-
natured, she thought:  still it had VERY long claws and a great
many teeth, so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect.

  `Cheshire Puss,' she began, rather timidly, as she did not at
all know whether it would like the name:  however, it only
grinned a little wider.  `Come, it's pleased so far,' thought
Alice, and she went on.  `Would you tell me, please, which way I
ought to go from here?'

  `That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,' said
the Cat.

  `I don't much care where--' said Alice.

  `Then it doesn't matter which way you go,' said the Cat.

  `--so long as I get SOMEWHERE,' Alice added as an explanation.

  `Oh, you're sure to do that,' said the Cat, `if you only walk
long enough.'

  Alice felt that this could not be denied, so she tried another
question.  `What sort of people live about here?'

  `In THAT direction,' the Cat said, waving its right paw round,
`lives a Hatter:  and in THAT direction,' waving the other paw,
`lives a March Hare.  Visit either you like:  they're both mad.'

  `But I don't want to go among mad people,' Alice remarked.

  `Oh, you can't help that,' said the Cat:  `we're all mad here.
I'm mad.  You're mad.'

  `How do you know I'm mad?' said Alice.

  `You must be,' said the Cat, `or you wouldn't have come here.'

  Alice didn't think that proved it at all; however, she went on
`And how do you know that you're mad?'

  `To begin with,' said the Cat, `a dog's not mad.  You grant
that?'

  `I suppose so,' said Alice.

  `Well, then,' the Cat went on, `you see, a dog growls when it's
angry, and wags its tail when it's pleased.  Now I growl when I'm
pleased, and wag my tail when I'm angry.  Therefore I'm mad.'

  `I call it purring, not growling,' said Alice.

  `Call it what you like,' said the Cat.  `Do you play croquet
with the Queen to-day?'

  `I should like it very much,' said Alice, `but I haven't been
invited yet.'

  `You'll see me there,' said the Cat, and vanished.

  Alice was not much surprised at this, she was getting so used
to queer things happening.  While she was looking at the place
where it had been, it suddenly appeared again.

  `By-the-bye, what became of the baby?' said the Cat.  `I'd
nearly forgotten to ask.'

  `It turned into a pig,' Alice quietly said, just as if it had
come back in a natural way.

  `I thought it would,' said the Cat, and vanished again.

  Alice waited a little, half expecting to see it again, but it
did not appear, and after a minute or two she walked on in the
direction in which the March Hare was said to live.  `I've seen
hatters before,' she said to herself; `the March Hare will be
much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won't be
raving mad--at least not so mad as it was in March.'  As she said
this, she looked up, and there was the Cat again, sitting on a
branch of a tree.

  `Did you say pig, or fig?' said the Cat.

  `I said pig,' replied Alice; `and I wish you wouldn't keep
appearing and vanishing so suddenly:  you make one quite giddy.'

  `All right,' said the Cat; and this time it vanished quite slowly,
beginning with the end of the tail, and ending with the grin,
which remained some time after the rest of it had gone.

  `Well!  I've often seen a cat without a grin,' thought Alice;
`but a grin without a cat!  It's the most curious thing I ever
saw in my life!'

  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
house of the March Hare:  she thought it must be the right house,
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
thatched with fur.  It was so large a house, that she did not
like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand
bit of mushroom, and raised herself to about two feet high:  even
then she walked up towards it rather timidly, saying to herself
`Suppose it should be raving mad after all!  I almost wish I'd
gone to see the Hatter instead!'



                           CHAPTER VII

                         A Mad Tea-Party


  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a
Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two
were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and talking
over its head.  `Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,' thought Alice;
`only, as it's asleep, I suppose it doesn't mind.'

  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded
together at one corner of it:  `No room!  No room!' they cried
out when they saw Alice coming.  `There's PLENTY of room!' said
Alice indignantly, and she sat down in a large arm-chair at one
end of the table.

  `Have some wine,' the March Hare said in an encouraging tone.

  Alice looked all round the table, but there was nothing on it
but tea.  `I don't see any wine,' she remarked.

  `There isn't any,' said the March Hare.

  `Then it wasn't very civil of you to offer it,' said Alice
angrily.

  `It wasn't very civil of you to sit down without being
invited,' said the March Hare.

  `I didn't know it was YOUR table,' said Alice; `it's laid for a
great many more than three.'

  `Your hair wants cutting,' said the Hatter.  He had been
looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity, and this was
his first speech.

  `You should learn not to make personal remarks,' Alice said
with some severity; `it's very rude.'

  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this; but all
he SAID was, `Why is a raven like a writing-desk?'

  `Come, we shall have some fun now!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad
they've begun asking riddles.--I believe I can guess that,' she
added aloud.

  `Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?'
said the March Hare.

  `Exactly so,' said Alice.

  `Then you should say what you mean,' the March Hare went on.

  `I do,' Alice hastily replied; `at least--at least I mean what
I say--that's the same thing, you know.'

  `Not the same thing a bit!' said the Hatter.  `You might just
as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat
what I see"!'

  `You might just as well say,' added the March Hare, `that "I
like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"!'

  `You might just as well say,' added the Dormouse, who seemed to
be talking in his sleep, `that "I breathe when I sleep" is the
same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"!'

  `It IS the same thing with you,' said the Hatter, and here the
conversation dropped, and the party sat silent for a minute,
while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writing-desks, which wasn't much.

  The Hatter was the first to break the silence.  `What day of
the month is it?' he said, turning to Alice:  he had taken his
watch out of his pocket, and was looking at it uneasily, shaking
it every now and then, and holding it to his ear.

  Alice considered a little, and then said `The fourth.'

  `Two days wrong!' sighed the Hatter.  `I told you butter
wouldn't suit the works!' he added looking angrily at the March
Hare.

  `It was the BEST butter,' the March Hare meekly replied.

  `Yes, but some crumbs must have got in as well,' the Hatter
grumbled:  `you shouldn't have put it in with the bread-knife.'

  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily:  then
he dipped it into his cup of tea, and looked at it again:  but he
could think of nothing better to say than his first remark, `It
was the BEST butter, you know.'

  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity.
`What a funny watch!' she remarked.  `It tells the day of the
month, and doesn't tell what o'clock it is!'

  `Why should it?' muttered the Hatter.  `Does YOUR watch tell
you what year it is?'

  `Of course not,' Alice replied very readily:  `but that's
because it stays the same year for such a long time together.'

  `Which is just the case with MINE,' said the Hatter.

  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatter's remark seemed to
have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
`I don't quite understand you,' she said, as politely as she
could.

  `The Dormouse is asleep again,' said the Hatter, and he poured
a little hot tea upon its nose.

  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without
opening its eyes, `Of course, of course; just what I was going to
remark myself.'

  `Have you guessed the riddle yet?' the Hatter said, turning to
Alice again.

  `No, I give it up,' Alice replied:  `what's the answer?'

  `I haven't the slightest idea,' said the Hatter.

  `Nor I,' said the March Hare.

  Alice sighed wearily.  `I think you might do something better
with the time,' she said, `than waste it in asking riddles that
have no answers.'

  `If you knew Time as well as I do,' said the Hatter, `you
wouldn't talk about wasting IT.  It's HIM.'

  `I don't know what you mean,' said Alice.

  `Of course you don't!' the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously.  `I dare say you never even spoke to Time!'

  `Perhaps not,' Alice cautiously replied:  `but I know I have to
beat time when I learn music.'

  `Ah! that accounts for it,' said the Hatter.  `He won't stand
beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, he'd do
almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose
it were nine o'clock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:
you'd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling!  Half-past one, time for dinner!'

  (`I only wish it was,' the March Hare said to itself in a
whisper.)

  `That would be grand, certainly,' said Alice thoughtfully:
`but then--I shouldn't be hungry for it, you know.'

  `Not at first, perhaps,' said the Hatter:  `but you could keep
it to half-past one as long as you liked.'

  `Is that the way YOU manage?' Alice asked.

  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  `Not I!' he replied.
`We quarrelled last March--just before HE went mad, you know--'
(pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare,) `--it was at the
great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
            How I wonder what you're at!"

You know the song, perhaps?'

  `I've heard something like it,' said Alice.

  `It goes on, you know,' the Hatter continued, `in this way:--

            "Up above the world you fly,
            Like a tea-tray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle--"'

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
`Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle--' and went on so long that
they had to pinch it to make it stop.

  `Well, I'd hardly finished the first verse,' said the Hatter,
`when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "He's murdering the
time!  Off with his head!"'

  `How dreadfully savage!' exclaimed Alice.

  `And ever since that,' the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,
`he won't do a thing I ask!  It's always six o'clock now.'

  A bright idea came into Alice's head.  `Is that the reason so
many tea-things are put out here?' she asked.

  `Yes, that's it,' said the Hatter with a sigh:  `it's always
tea-time, and we've no time to wash the things between whiles.'

  `Then you keep moving round, I suppose?' said Alice.

  `Exactly so,' said the Hatter:  `as the things get used up.'

  `But what happens when you come to the beginning again?' Alice
ventured to ask.

  `Suppose we change the subject,' the March Hare interrupted,
yawning.  `I'm getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady
tells us a story.'

  `I'm afraid I don't know one,' said Alice, rather alarmed at
the proposal.

  `Then the Dormouse shall!' they both cried.  `Wake up,
Dormouse!'  And they pinched it on both sides at once.

  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  `I wasn't asleep,' he
said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  `I heard every word you fellows
were saying.'

  `Tell us a story!' said the March Hare.

  `Yes, please do!' pleaded Alice.

  `And be quick about it,' added the Hatter, `or you'll be asleep
again before it's done.'

  `Once upon a time there were three little sisters,' the
Dormouse began in a great hurry; `and their names were Elsie,
Lacie, and Tillie; and they lived at the bottom of a well--'

  `What did they live on?' said Alice, who always took a great
interest in questions of eating and drinking.

  `They lived on treacle,' said the Dormouse, after thinking a
minute or two.

  `They couldn't have done that, you know,' Alice gently
remarked; `they'd have been ill.'

  `So they were,' said the Dormouse; `VERY ill.'

  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways
of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went
on:  `But why did they live at the bottom of a well?'

  `Take some more tea,' the March Hare said to Alice, very
earnestly.

  `I've had nothing yet,' Alice replied in an offended tone, `so
I can't take more.'

  `You mean you can't take LESS,' said the Hatter:  `it's very
easy to take MORE than nothing.'

  `Nobody asked YOUR opinion,' said Alice.

  `Who's making personal remarks now?' the Hatter asked
triumphantly.

  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped
herself to some tea and bread-and-butter, and then turned to the
Dormouse, and repeated her question.  `Why did they live at the
bottom of a well?'

  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and
then said, `It was a treacle-well.'

  `There's no such thing!'  Alice was beginning very angrily, but
the Hatter and the March Hare went `Sh! sh!' and the Dormouse
sulkily remarked, `If you can't be civil, you'd better finish the
story for yourself.'

  `No, please go on!' Alice said very humbly; `I won't interrupt
again.  I dare say there may be ONE.'

  `One, indeed!' said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he
consented to go on.  `And so these three little sisters--they
were learning to draw, you know--'

  `What did they draw?' said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

  `Treacle,' said the Dormouse, without considering at all this
time.

  `I want a clean cup,' interrupted the Hatter:  `let's all move
one place on.'

  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the
March Hare moved into the Dormouse's place, and Alice rather
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a
good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset
the milk-jug into his plate.

  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began
very cautiously:  `But I don't understand.  Where did they draw
the treacle from?'

  `You can draw water out of a water-well,' said the Hatter; `so
I should think you could draw treacle out of a treacle-well--eh,
stupid?'

  `But they were IN the well,' Alice said to the Dormouse, not
choosing to notice this last remark.

  `Of course they were', said the Dormouse; `--well in.'

  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse
go on for some time without interrupting it.

  `They were learning to draw,' the Dormouse went on, yawning and
rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy; `and they drew
all manner of things--everything that begins with an M--'

  `Why with an M?' said Alice.

  `Why not?' said the March Hare.

  Alice was silent.

  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going
off into a doze; but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
again with a little shriek, and went on:  `--that begins with an
M, such as mouse-traps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness--
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"--did you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?'

  `Really, now you ask me,' said Alice, very much confused, `I
don't think--'

  `Then you shouldn't talk,' said the Hatter.

  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got
up in great disgust, and walked off; the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her
going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that
they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

  `At any rate I'll never go THERE again!' said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood.  `It's the stupidest tea-party I
ever was at in all my life!'

  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it.  `That's very curious!' she thought.
`But everything's curious today.  I think I may as well go in at once.'
And in she went.

  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
little glass table.  `Now, I'll manage better this time,'
she said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key,
and unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went
to work nibbling at the mushroom (she had kept a piece of it
in her pocket) till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down
the little passage:  and THEN--she found herself at last in the
beautiful garden, among the bright flower-beds and the cool fountains.



                          CHAPTER VIII

                   The Queen's Croquet-Ground


  A large rose-tree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the
roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say, `Look out now, Five!  Don't go
splashing paint over me like that!'

  `I couldn't help it,' said Five, in a sulky tone; `Seven jogged
my elbow.'

  On which Seven looked up and said, `That's right, Five!  Always
lay the blame on others!'

  `YOU'D better not talk!' said Five.  `I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!'

  `What for?' said the one who had spoken first.

  `That's none of YOUR business, Two!' said Seven.

  `Yes, it IS his business!' said Five, `and I'll tell him--it
was for bringing the cook tulip-roots instead of onions.'

  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun `Well, of all
the unjust things--' when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as
she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the
others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.

  `Would you tell me,' said Alice, a little timidly, `why you are
painting those roses?'

  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a
low voice, `Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to
have been a RED rose-tree, and we put a white one in by mistake;
and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads
cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, we're doing our best, afore
she comes, to--'  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously
looking across the garden, called out `The Queen!  The Queen!'
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
looked round, eager to see the Queen.

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs; these were all shaped
like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and
feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers; these were
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the
soldiers did.  After these came the royal children; there were
ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
King's crown on a crimson velvet cushion; and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember
ever having heard of such a rule at processions; `and besides,
what would be the use of a procession,' thought she, `if people
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldn't see it?'
So she stood still where she was, and waited.

  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped
and looked at her, and the Queen said severely `Who is this?'
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in reply.

  `Idiot!' said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently; and,
turning to Alice, she went on, `What's your name, child?'

  `My name is Alice, so please your Majesty,' said Alice very
politely; but she added, to herself, `Why, they're only a pack of
cards, after all.  I needn't be afraid of them!'

  `And who are THESE?' said the Queen, pointing to the three
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree; for, you see, as
they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs
was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her
own children.

  `How should I know?' said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
`It's no business of MINE.'

  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her
for a moment like a wild beast, screamed `Off with her head!
Off--'

  `Nonsense!' said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the
Queen was silent.

  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said
`Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!'

  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave
`Turn them over!'

  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

  `Get up!' said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the
three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the
King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.

  `Leave off that!' screamed the Queen.  `You make me giddy.'
And then, turning to the rose-tree, she went on, `What HAVE you
been doing here?'

  `May it please your Majesty,' said Two, in a very humble tone,
going down on one knee as he spoke, `we were trying--'

  `I see!' said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the
roses.  `Off with their heads!' and the procession moved on,
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.

  `You shan't be beheaded!' said Alice, and she put them into a
large flower-pot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered
about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly
marched off after the others.

  `Are their heads off?' shouted the Queen.

  `Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty!' the soldiers
shouted in reply.

  `That's right!' shouted the Queen.  `Can you play croquet?'

  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question
was evidently meant for her.

  `Yes!' shouted Alice.

  `Come on, then!' roared the Queen, and Alice joined the
procession, wondering very much what would happen next.

  `It's--it's a very fine day!' said a timid voice at her side.
She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously
into her face.

  `Very,' said Alice:  `--where's the Duchess?'

  `Hush!  Hush!' said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and
whispered `She's under sentence of execution.'

  `What for?' said Alice.

  `Did you say "What a pity!"?' the Rabbit asked.

  `No, I didn't,' said Alice:  `I don't think it's at all a pity.
I said "What for?"'

  `She boxed the Queen's ears--' the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a
little scream of laughter.  `Oh, hush!' the Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone.  `The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came
rather late, and the Queen said--'

  `Get to your places!' shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,
and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up
against each other; however, they got settled down in a minute or
two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a
curious croquet-ground in her life; it was all ridges and
furrows; the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live
flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,
comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,
but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it
WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:
and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubled-up soldiers
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
difficult game indeed.

  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,
quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs; and in
a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went
stamping about, and shouting `Off with his head!' or `Off with
her head!' about once in a minute.

  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as
yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might
happen any minute, `and then,' thought she, `what would become of
me?  They're dreadfully fond of beheading people here; the great
wonder is, that there's any one left alive!'

  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering
whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a
curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at
first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to
be a grin, and she said to herself `It's the Cheshire Cat:  now I
shall have somebody to talk to.'

  `How are you getting on?' said the Cat, as soon as there was
mouth enough for it to speak with.

  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then nodded.  `It's no
use speaking to it,' she thought, `till its ears have come, or at
least one of them.'  In another minute the whole head appeared,
and then Alice put down her flamingo, and began an account of the
game, feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her.  The
Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight, and
no more of it appeared.

  `I don't think they play at all fairly,' Alice began, in rather
a complaining tone, `and they all quarrel so dreadfully one can't
hear oneself speak--and they don't seem to have any rules in
particular; at least, if there are, nobody attends to them--and
you've no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive;
for instance, there's the arch I've got to go through next
walking about at the other end of the ground--and I should have
croqueted the Queen's hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it
saw mine coming!'

  `How do you like the Queen?' said the Cat in a low voice.

  `Not at all,' said Alice:  `she's so extremely--'  Just then
she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so
she went on, `--likely to win, that it's hardly worth while
finishing the game.'

  The Queen smiled and passed on.

  `Who ARE you talking to?' said the King, going up to Alice, and
looking at the Cat's head with great curiosity.

  `It's a friend of mine--a Cheshire Cat,' said Alice:  `allow me
to introduce it.'

  `I don't like the look of it at all,' said the King:
`however, it may kiss my hand if it likes.'

  `I'd rather not,' the Cat remarked.

  `Don't be impertinent,' said the King, `and don't look at me
like that!'  He got behind Alice as he spoke.

  `A cat may look at a king,' said Alice.  `I've read that in
some book, but I don't remember where.'

  `Well, it must be removed,' said the King very decidedly, and
he called the Queen, who was passing at the moment, `My dear!  I
wish you would have this cat removed!'

  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties, great
or small.  `Off with his head!' she said, without even looking
round.

  `I'll fetch the executioner myself,' said the King eagerly, and
he hurried off.

  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game
was going on, as she heard the Queen's voice in the distance,
screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and
she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.

  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree.

  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,
the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:
`but it doesn't matter much,' thought Alice, `as all the arches
are gone from this side of the ground.'  So she tucked it away
under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for
a little more conversation with her friend.

  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to
find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute
going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,
and looked very uncomfortable.

  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to
settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,
though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed
to make out exactly what they said.

  The executioner's argument was, that you couldn't cut off a
head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had
never had to do such a thing before, and he wasn't going to begin
at HIS time of life.

  The King's argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you weren't to talk nonsense.

  The Queen's argument was, that if something wasn't done about
it in less than no time she'd have everybody executed, all round.
(It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
grave and anxious.)

  Alice could think of nothing else to say but `It belongs to the
Duchess:  you'd better ask HER about it.'

  `She's in prison,' the Queen said to the executioner:  `fetch
her here.'  And the executioner went off like an arrow.

   The Cat's head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the Duchess, it had entirely
disappeared; so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and down
looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.



                           CHAPTER IX

                     The Mock Turtle's Story


  `You can't think how glad I am to see you again, you dear old
thing!' said the Duchess, as she tucked her arm affectionately
into Alice's, and they walked off together.

  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper, and
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen.

  `When I'M a Duchess,' she said to herself, (not in a very
hopeful tone though), `I won't have any pepper in my kitchen AT
ALL.  Soup does very well without--Maybe it's always pepper that
makes people hot-tempered,' she went on, very much pleased at
having found out a new kind of rule, `and vinegar that makes them
sour--and camomile that makes them bitter--and--and barley-sugar
and such things that make children sweet-tempered.  I only wish
people knew that:  then they wouldn't be so stingy about it, you
know--'

  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a
little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.
`You're thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you
forget to talk.  I can't tell you just now what the moral of that
is, but I shall remember it in a bit.'

  `Perhaps it hasn't one,' Alice ventured to remark.

  `Tut, tut, child!' said the Duchess.  `Everything's got a
moral, if only you can find it.'  And she squeezed herself up
closer to Alice's side as she spoke.

  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,
because the Duchess was VERY ugly; and secondly, because she was
exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alice's shoulder,
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not
like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.

  `The game's going on rather better now,' she said, by way of
keeping up the conversation a little.

  `'Tis so,' said the Duchess:  `and the moral of that is--"Oh,
'tis love, 'tis love, that makes the world go round!"'

  `Somebody said,' Alice whispered, `that it's done by everybody
minding their own business!'

  `Ah, well!  It means much the same thing,' said the Duchess,
digging her sharp little chin into Alice's shoulder as she added,
`and the moral of THAT is--"Take care of the sense, and the
sounds will take care of themselves."'

  `How fond she is of finding morals in things!' Alice thought to
herself.

  `I dare say you're wondering why I don't put my arm round your
waist,' the Duchess said after a pause:  `the reason is, that I'm
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the
experiment?'

  `HE might bite,' Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all
anxious to have the experiment tried.

  `Very true,' said the Duchess:  `flamingoes and mustard both
bite.  And the moral of that is--"Birds of a feather flock
together."'

  `Only mustard isn't a bird,' Alice remarked.

  `Right, as usual,' said the Duchess:  `what a clear way you
have of putting things!'

  `It's a mineral, I THINK,' said Alice.

  `Of course it is,' said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree
to everything that Alice said; `there's a large mustard-mine near
here.  And the moral of that is--"The more there is of mine, the
less there is of yours."'

  `Oh, I know!' exclaimed Alice, who had not attended to this
last remark, `it's a vegetable.  It doesn't look like one, but it
is.'

  `I quite agree with you,' said the Duchess; `and the moral of
that is--"Be what you would seem to be"--or if you'd like it put
more simply--"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared
to them to be otherwise."'

  `I think I should understand that better,' Alice said very
politely, `if I had it written down:  but I can't quite follow it
as you say it.'

  `That's nothing to what I could say if I chose,' the Duchess
replied, in a pleased tone.

  `Pray don't trouble yourself to say it any longer than that,'
said Alice.

  `Oh, don't talk about trouble!' said the Duchess.  `I make you
a present of everything I've said as yet.'

  `A cheap sort of present!' thought Alice.  `I'm glad they don't
give birthday presents like that!'  But she did not venture to
say it out loud.

  `Thinking again?' the Duchess asked, with another dig of her
sharp little chin.

  `I've a right to think,' said Alice sharply, for she was
beginning to feel a little worried.

  `Just about as much right,' said the Duchess, `as pigs have to fly;
and the m--'

  But here, to Alice's great surprise, the Duchess's voice died
away, even in the middle of her favourite word `moral,' and the
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble.  Alice looked up,
and there stood the Queen in front of them, with her arms folded,
frowning like a thunderstorm.

  `A fine day, your Majesty!' the Duchess began in a low, weak
voice.

  `Now, I give you fair warning,' shouted the Queen, stamping on
the ground as she spoke; `either you or your head must be off,
and that in about half no time!  Take your choice!'

  The Duchess took her choice, and was gone in a moment.

  `Let's go on with the game,' the Queen said to Alice; and Alice
was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her
back to the croquet-ground.

  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queen's absence,
and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,
they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a
moment's delay would cost them their lives.

  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
quarrelling with the other players, and shouting `Off with his
head!' or `Off with her head!'  Those whom she sentenced were
taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the
King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of
execution.

  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to
Alice, `Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?'

  `No,' said Alice.  `I don't even know what a Mock Turtle is.'

  `It's the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from,' said the Queen.

  `I never saw one, or heard of one,' said Alice.

  `Come on, then,' said the Queen, `and he shall tell you his
history,'

  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low
voice, to the company generally, `You are all pardoned.'  `Come,
THAT'S a good thing!' she said to herself, for she had felt quite
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.

  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the
sun.  (IF you don't know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.)
`Up, lazy thing!' said the Queen, `and take this young lady to
see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and
see after some executions I have ordered'; and she walked off,
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like
the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen:  so she waited.

  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the
Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  `What fun!'
said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.

  `What IS the fun?' said Alice.

  `Why, SHE,' said the Gryphon.  `It's all her fancy, that:  they
never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!'

  `Everybody says "come on!" here,' thought Alice, as she went
slowly after it:  `I never was so ordered about in all my life,
never!'

  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
distance, sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock, and,
as they came nearer, Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart
would break.  She pitied him deeply.  `What is his sorrow?' she
asked the Gryphon, and the Gryphon answered, very nearly in the
same words as before, `It's all his fancy, that:  he hasn't got
no sorrow, you know.  Come on!'

  So they went up to the Mock Turtle, who looked at them with
large eyes full of tears, but said nothing.

  `This here young lady,' said the Gryphon, `she wants for to
know your history, she do.'

  `I'll tell it her,' said the Mock Turtle in a deep, hollow
tone:  `sit down, both of you, and don't speak a word till I've
finished.'

  So they sat down, and nobody spoke for some minutes.  Alice
thought to herself, `I don't see how he can EVEN finish, if he
doesn't begin.'  But she waited patiently.

  `Once,' said the Mock Turtle at last, with a deep sigh, `I was
a real Turtle.'

  These words were followed by a very long silence, broken only
by an occasional exclamation of `Hjckrrh!' from the Gryphon, and
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle.  Alice was very
nearly getting up and saying, `Thank you, sir, for your
interesting story,' but she could not help thinking there MUST be
more to come, so she sat still and said nothing.

  `When we were little,' the Mock Turtle went on at last, more
calmly, though still sobbing a little now and then, `we went to
school in the sea.  The master was an old Turtle--we used to call
him Tortoise--'

  `Why did you call him Tortoise, if he wasn't one?' Alice asked.

  `We called him Tortoise because he taught us,' said the Mock
Turtle angrily:  `really you are very dull!'

  `You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question,' added the Gryphon; and then they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice, who felt ready to sink into the earth.  At
last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle, `Drive on, old fellow!
Don't be all day about it!' and he went on in these words:

  `Yes, we went to school in the sea, though you mayn't believe
it--'

  `I never said I didn't!' interrupted Alice.

  `You did,' said the Mock Turtle.

  `Hold your tongue!' added the Gryphon, before Alice could speak
again.  The Mock Turtle went on.

  `We had the best of educations--in fact, we went to school
every day--'

  `I'VE been to a day-school, too,' said Alice; `you needn't be
so proud as all that.'

  `With extras?' asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously.

  `Yes,' said Alice, `we learned French and music.'

  `And washing?' said the Mock Turtle.

  `Certainly not!' said Alice indignantly.

  `Ah! then yours wasn't a really good school,' said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief.  `Now at OURS they had at the
end of the bill, "French, music, AND WASHING--extra."'

  `You couldn't have wanted it much,' said Alice; `living at the
bottom of the sea.'

  `I couldn't afford to learn it.' said the Mock Turtle with a
sigh.  `I only took the regular course.'

  `What was that?' inquired Alice.

  `Reeling and Writhing, of course, to begin with,' the Mock
Turtle replied; `and then the different branches of Arithmetic--
Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision.'

  `I never heard of "Uglification,"' Alice ventured to say.  `What is it?'

  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise.  `What!  Never
heard of uglifying!' it exclaimed.  `You know what to beautify is,
I suppose?'

  `Yes,' said Alice doubtfully:  `it means--to--make--anything--prettier.'

  `Well, then,' the Gryphon went on, `if you don't know what to
uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.'

  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said `What else had you
to learn?'

  `Well, there was Mystery,' the Mock Turtle replied, counting
off the subjects on his flappers, `--Mystery, ancient and modern,
with Seaography:  then Drawling--the Drawling-master was an old
conger-eel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us
Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.'

  `What was THAT like?' said Alice.

  `Well, I can't show it you myself,' the Mock Turtle said:  `I'm
too stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.'

  `Hadn't time,' said the Gryphon:  `I went to the Classics
master, though.  He was an old crab, HE was.'

  `I never went to him,' the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  `he
taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.'

  `So he did, so he did,' said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn;
and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.

  `And how many hours a day did you do lessons?' said Alice, in a
hurry to change the subject.

  `Ten hours the first day,' said the Mock Turtle: `nine the
next, and so on.'

  `What a curious plan!' exclaimed Alice.

  `That's the reason they're called lessons,' the Gryphon
remarked:  `because they lessen from day to day.'

  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a
little before she made her next remark.  `Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday?'

  `Of course it was,' said the Mock Turtle.

  `And how did you manage on the twelfth?' Alice went on eagerly.

  `That's enough about lessons,' the Gryphon interrupted in a
very decided tone:  `tell her something about the games now.'



                            CHAPTER X

                      The Lobster Quadrille


  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper
across his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for
a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  `Same as if he had a bone
in his throat,' said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him
and punching him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered
his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on
again:--

  `You may not have lived much under the sea--' (`I haven't,' said Alice)--
`and perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster--'
(Alice began to say `I once tasted--' but checked herself hastily,
and said `No, never') `--so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a Lobster Quadrille is!'

  `No, indeed,' said Alice.  `What sort of a dance is it?'

  `Why,' said the Gryphon, `you first form into a line along the sea-shore--'

  `Two lines!' cried the Mock Turtle.  `Seals, turtles, salmon, and so on;
then, when you've cleared all the jelly-fish out of the way--'

  `THAT generally takes some time,' interrupted the Gryphon.

  `--you advance twice--'

  `Each with a lobster as a partner!' cried the Gryphon.

  `Of course,' the Mock Turtle said:  `advance twice, set to
partners--'

  `--change lobsters, and retire in same order,' continued the
Gryphon.

  `Then, you know,' the Mock Turtle went on, `you throw the--'

  `The lobsters!' shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

  `--as far out to sea as you can--'

  `Swim after them!' screamed the Gryphon.

  `Turn a somersault in the sea!' cried the Mock Turtle,
capering wildly about.

  `Change lobsters again!' yelled the Gryphon at the top of its voice.

  `Back to land again, and that's all the first figure,' said the
Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice; and the two creatures,
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat
down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

  `It must be a very pretty dance,' said Alice timidly.

  `Would you like to see a little of it?' said the Mock Turtle.

  `Very much indeed,' said Alice.

  `Come, let's try the first figure!' said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon.  `We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall
sing?'

  `Oh, YOU sing,' said the Gryphon.  `I've forgotten the words.'

  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now
and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and
waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle
sang this, very slowly and sadly:--


`"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
"There's a porpoise close behind us, and he's treading on my
 tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
They are waiting on the shingle--will you come and join the
dance?

Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the
dance?
Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the
dance?


"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us, with the lobsters, out to
                                                      sea!"
But the snail replied "Too far, too far!" and gave a look
                                                       askance--
Said he thanked the whiting kindly, but he would not join the
   dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, would not join
        the dance.
    Would not, could not, would not, could not, could not join
        the dance.

`"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied.
"There is another shore, you know, upon the other side.
The further off from England the nearer is to France--
Then turn not pale, beloved snail, but come and join the dance.

    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, will you join the
         dance?
    Will you, won't you, will you, won't you, won't you join the
         dance?"'



  `Thank you, it's a very interesting dance to watch,' said
Alice, feeling very glad that it was over at last:  `and I do so
like that curious song about the whiting!'

  `Oh, as to the whiting,' said the Mock Turtle, `they--you've
seen them, of course?'

  `Yes,' said Alice, `I've often seen them at dinn--' she
checked herself hastily.

  `I don't know where Dinn may be,' said the Mock Turtle, `but
if you've seen them so often, of course you know what they're
like.'

  `I believe so,' Alice replied thoughtfully.  `They have their
tails in their mouths--and they're all over crumbs.'

  `You're wrong about the crumbs,' said the Mock Turtle:
`crumbs would all wash off in the sea.  But they HAVE their tails
in their mouths; and the reason is--' here the Mock Turtle
yawned and shut his eyes.--`Tell her about the reason and all
that,' he said to the Gryphon.

  `The reason is,' said the Gryphon, `that they WOULD go with
the lobsters to the dance.  So they got thrown out to sea.  So
they had to fall a long way.  So they got their tails fast in
their mouths.  So they couldn't get them out again.  That's all.'

  `Thank you,' said Alice, `it's very interesting.  I never knew
so much about a whiting before.'

  `I can tell you more than that, if you like,' said the
Gryphon.  `Do you know why it's called a whiting?'

  `I never thought about it,' said Alice.  `Why?'

  `IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES.' the Gryphon replied very
solemnly.

  Alice was thoroughly puzzled.  `Does the boots and shoes!' she
repeated in a wondering tone.

  `Why, what are YOUR shoes done with?' said the Gryphon.  `I
mean, what makes them so shiny?'

  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she
gave her answer.  `They're done with blacking, I believe.'

  `Boots and shoes under the sea,' the Gryphon went on in a deep
voice, `are done with a whiting.  Now you know.'

  `And what are they made of?' Alice asked in a tone of great
curiosity.

  `Soles and eels, of course,' the Gryphon replied rather
impatiently:  `any shrimp could have told you that.'

  `If I'd been the whiting,' said Alice, whose thoughts were
still running on the song, `I'd have said to the porpoise, "Keep
back, please:  we don't want YOU with us!"'

  `They were obliged to have him with them,' the Mock Turtle
said:  `no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.'

  `Wouldn't it really?' said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

  `Of course not,' said the Mock Turtle:  `why, if a fish came
to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With
what porpoise?"'

  `Don't you mean "purpose"?' said Alice.

  `I mean what I say,' the Mock Turtle replied in an offended
tone.  And the Gryphon added `Come, let's hear some of YOUR
adventures.'

  `I could tell you my adventures--beginning from this morning,'
said Alice a little timidly:  `but it's no use going back to
yesterday, because I was a different person then.'

  `Explain all that,' said the Mock Turtle.

  `No, no!  The adventures first,' said the Gryphon in an
impatient tone:  `explanations take such a dreadful time.'

  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when
she first saw the White Rabbit.  She was a little nervous about
it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on
each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she
gained courage as she went on.  Her listeners were perfectly
quiet till she got to the part about her repeating `YOU ARE OLD,
FATHER WILLIAM,' to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming
different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said
`That's very curious.'

  `It's all about as curious as it can be,' said the Gryphon.

  `It all came different!' the Mock Turtle repeated
thoughtfully.  `I should like to hear her try and repeat
something now.  Tell her to begin.'  He looked at the Gryphon as
if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.

  `Stand up and repeat "'TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD,"' said
the Gryphon.

  `How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat
lessons!' thought Alice; `I might as well be at school at once.'
However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so
full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was
saying, and the words came very queer indeed:--

    `'Tis the voice of the Lobster; I heard him declare,
    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.'

              [later editions continued as follows
    When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
    But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
    His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.]

  `That's different from what I used to say when I was a child,'
said the Gryphon.

  `Well, I never heard it before,' said the Mock Turtle; `but it
sounds uncommon nonsense.'

  Alice said nothing; she had sat down with her face in her
hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way
again.

  `I should like to have it explained,' said the Mock Turtle.

  `She can't explain it,' said the Gryphon hastily.  `Go on with
the next verse.'

  `But about his toes?' the Mock Turtle persisted.  `How COULD
he turn them out with his nose, you know?'

  `It's the first position in dancing.' Alice said; but was
dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the
subject.

  `Go on with the next verse,' the Gryphon repeated impatiently:
`it begins "I passed by his garden."'

  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would
all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:--

    `I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie--'

        [later editions continued as follows
    The Panther took pie-crust, and gravy, and meat,
    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
    When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
    And concluded the banquet--]

  `What IS the use of repeating all that stuff,' the Mock Turtle
interrupted, `if you don't explain it as you go on?  It's by far
the most confusing thing I ever heard!'

  `Yes, I think you'd better leave off,' said the Gryphon:  and
Alice was only too glad to do so.

  `Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille?' the
Gryphon went on.  `Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you
a song?'

  `Oh, a song, please, if the Mock Turtle would be so kind,'
Alice replied, so eagerly that the Gryphon said, in a rather
offended tone, `Hm!  No accounting for tastes!  Sing her
"Turtle Soup," will you, old fellow?'

  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and began, in a voice sometimes
choked with sobs, to sing this:--


    `Beautiful Soup, so rich and green,
    Waiting in a hot tureen!
    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
    Soup of the evening, beautiful Soup!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!

    `Beautiful Soup!  Who cares for fish,
    Game, or any other dish?
    Who would not give all else for two
    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
        Beau--ootiful Soo--oop!
    Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
        Beautiful, beauti--FUL SOUP!'

  `Chorus again!' cried the Gryphon, and the Mock Turtle had
just begun to repeat it, when a cry of `The trial's beginning!'
was heard in the distance.

  `Come on!' cried the Gryphon, and, taking Alice by the hand,
it hurried off, without waiting for the end of the song.

  `What trial is it?' Alice panted as she ran; but the Gryphon
only answered `Come on!' and ran the faster, while more and more
faintly came, carried on the breeze that followed them, the
melancholy words:--

    `Soo--oop of the e--e--evening,
        Beautiful, beautiful Soup!'



                           CHAPTER XI

                      Who Stole the Tarts?


  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about them--all sorts
of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:
the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on
each side to guard him; and near the King was the White Rabbit,
with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
other.  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large
dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice
quite hungry to look at them--`I wish they'd get the trial done,'
she thought, `and hand round the refreshments!'  But there seemed
to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
her, to pass away the time.

  Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had
read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that
she knew the name of nearly everything there.  `That's the
judge,' she said to herself, `because of his great wig.'

  The judge, by the way, was the King; and as he wore his crown
over the wig, (look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
did it,) he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly
not becoming.

  `And that's the jury-box,' thought Alice, `and those twelve
creatures,' (she was obliged to say `creatures,' you see, because
some of them were animals, and some were birds,) `I suppose they
are the jurors.'  She said this last word two or three times over
to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and
rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the
meaning of it at all.  However, `jury-men' would have done just
as well.

  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
`What are they doing?'  Alice whispered to the Gryphon.  `They
can't have anything to put down yet, before the trial's begun.'

  `They're putting down their names,' the Gryphon whispered in
reply, `for fear they should forget them before the end of the
trial.'

  `Stupid things!' Alice began in a loud, indignant voice, but
she stopped hastily, for the White Rabbit cried out, `Silence in
the court!' and the King put on his spectacles and looked
anxiously round, to make out who was talking.

  Alice could see, as well as if she were looking over their
shoulders, that all the jurors were writing down `stupid things!'
on their slates, and she could even make out that one of them
didn't know how to spell `stupid,' and that he had to ask his
neighbour to tell him.  `A nice muddle their slates'll be in
before the trial's over!' thought Alice.

  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked.  This of course,
Alice could not stand, and she went round the court and got
behind him, and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
away.  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror (it was
Bill, the Lizard) could not make out at all what had become of
it; so, after hunting all about for it, he was obliged to write
with one finger for the rest of the day; and this was of very
little use, as it left no mark on the slate.

  `Herald, read the accusation!' said the King.

  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet, and
then unrolled the parchment scroll, and read as follows:--

    `The Queen of Hearts, she made some tarts,
          All on a summer day:
      The Knave of Hearts, he stole those tarts,
          And took them quite away!'

  `Consider your verdict,' the King said to the jury.

  `Not yet, not yet!' the Rabbit hastily interrupted.  `There's
a great deal to come before that!'

  `Call the first witness,' said the King; and the White Rabbit
blew three blasts on the trumpet, and called out, `First
witness!'

  The first witness was the Hatter.  He came in with a teacup in
one hand and a piece of bread-and-butter in the other.  `I beg
pardon, your Majesty,' he began, `for bringing these in:  but I
hadn't quite finished my tea when I was sent for.'

  `You ought to have finished,' said the King.  `When did you
begin?'

  The Hatter looked at the March Hare, who had followed him into
the court, arm-in-arm with the Dormouse.  `Fourteenth of March, I
think it was,' he said.

  `Fifteenth,' said the March Hare.

  `Sixteenth,' added the Dormouse.

  `Write that down,' the King said to the jury, and the jury
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates, and then
added them up, and reduced the answer to shillings and pence.

  `Take off your hat,' the King said to the Hatter.

  `It isn't mine,' said the Hatter.

  `Stolen!' the King exclaimed, turning to the jury, who
instantly made a memorandum of the fact.

  `I keep them to sell,' the Hatter added as an explanation;
`I've none of my own.  I'm a hatter.'

  Here the Queen put on her spectacles, and began staring at the
Hatter, who turned pale and fidgeted.

  `Give your evidence,' said the King; `and don't be nervous, or
I'll have you executed on the spot.'

  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all:  he kept
shifting from one foot to the other, looking uneasily at the
Queen, and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
teacup instead of the bread-and-butter.

  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation, which
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was:  she was
beginning to grow larger again, and she thought at first she
would get up and leave the court; but on second thoughts she
decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for
her.

  `I wish you wouldn't squeeze so.' said the Dormouse, who was
sitting next to her.  `I can hardly breathe.'

  `I can't help it,' said Alice very meekly:  `I'm growing.'

  `You've no right to grow here,' said the Dormouse.

  `Don't talk nonsense,' said Alice more boldly:  `you know
you're growing too.'

  `Yes, but I grow at a reasonable pace,' said the Dormouse:
`not in that ridiculous fashion.'  And he got up very sulkily
and crossed over to the other side of the court.

  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the
Hatter, and, just as the Dormouse crossed the court, she said to
one of the officers of the court, `Bring me the list of the
singers in the last concert!' on which the wretched Hatter
trembled so, that he shook both his shoes off.

  `Give your evidence,' the King repeated angrily, `or I'll have
you executed, whether you're nervous or not.'

  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' the Hatter began, in a
trembling voice, `--and I hadn't begun my tea--not above a week
or so--and what with the bread-and-butter getting so thin--and
the twinkling of the tea--'

  `The twinkling of the what?' said the King.

  `It began with the tea,' the Hatter replied.

  `Of course twinkling begins with a T!' said the King sharply.
`Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on!'

  `I'm a poor man,' the Hatter went on, `and most things
twinkled after that--only the March Hare said--'

  `I didn't!' the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry.

  `You did!' said the Hatter.

  `I deny it!' said the March Hare.

  `He denies it,' said the King:  `leave out that part.'

  `Well, at any rate, the Dormouse said--' the Hatter went on,
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too:  but the
Dormouse denied nothing, being fast asleep.

  `After that,' continued the Hatter, `I cut some more bread-
and-butter--'

  `But what did the Dormouse say?' one of the jury asked.

  `That I can't remember,' said the Hatter.

  `You MUST remember,' remarked the King, `or I'll have you
executed.'

  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and bread-and-butter,
and went down on one knee.  `I'm a poor man, your Majesty,' he
began.

  `You're a very poor speaker,' said the King.

  Here one of the guinea-pigs cheered, and was immediately
suppressed by the officers of the court.  (As that is rather a
hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had
a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:
into this they slipped the guinea-pig, head first, and then sat
upon it.)

  `I'm glad I've seen that done,' thought Alice.  `I've so often
read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some
attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the
officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant
till now.'

  `If that's all you know about it, you may stand down,'
continued the King.

  `I can't go no lower,' said the Hatter:  `I'm on the floor, as
it is.'

  `Then you may SIT down,' the King replied.

  Here the other guinea-pig cheered, and was suppressed.

  `Come, that finished the guinea-pigs!' thought Alice.  `Now we
shall get on better.'

  `I'd rather finish my tea,' said the Hatter, with an anxious
look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

  `You may go,' said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the
court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.

  `--and just take his head off outside,' the Queen added to one
of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the
officer could get to the door.

  `Call the next witness!' said the King.

  The next witness was the Duchess's cook.  She carried the
pepper-box in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before
she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began
sneezing all at once.

  `Give your evidence,' said the King.

  `Shan't,' said the cook.

  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a
low voice, `Your Majesty must cross-examine THIS witness.'

  `Well, if I must, I must,' the King said, with a melancholy
air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, `What
are tarts made of?'

  `Pepper, mostly,' said the cook.

  `Treacle,' said a sleepy voice behind her.

  `Collar that Dormouse,' the Queen shrieked out.  `Behead that
Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch
him!  Off with his whiskers!'

  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the
Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down
again, the cook had disappeared.

  `Never mind!' said the King, with an air of great relief.
`Call the next witness.'  And he added in an undertone to the
Queen, `Really, my dear, YOU must cross-examine the next witness.
It quite makes my forehead ache!'

  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,
`--for they haven't got much evidence YET,' she said to herself.
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top
of his shrill little voice, the name `Alice!'



                           CHAPTER XII

                        Alice's Evidence


  `Here!' cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jury-box with
the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before.

  `Oh, I BEG your pardon!' she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jury-box, or they would die.

  `The trial cannot proceed,' said the King in a very grave
voice, `until all the jurymen are back in their proper places--
ALL,' he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
he said do.

  Alice looked at the jury-box, and saw that, in her haste, she
had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right; `not that
it signifies much,' she said to herself; `I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.'

  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,
gazing up into the roof of the court.

  `What do you know about this business?' the King said to
Alice.

  `Nothing,' said Alice.

  `Nothing WHATEVER?' persisted the King.

  `Nothing whatever,' said Alice.

  `That's very important,' the King said, turning to the jury.
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when
the White Rabbit interrupted:  `UNimportant, your Majesty means,
of course,' he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and
making faces at him as he spoke.

  `UNimportant, of course, I meant,' the King hastily said, and
went on to himself in an undertone, `important--unimportant--
unimportant--important--' as if he were trying which word
sounded best.

  Some of the jury wrote it down `important,' and some
`unimportant.'  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to
look over their slates; `but it doesn't matter a bit,' she
thought to herself.

  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
writing in his note-book, cackled out `Silence!' and read out
from his book, `Rule Forty-two.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.'

  Everybody looked at Alice.

  `I'M not a mile high,' said Alice.

  `You are,' said the King.

  `Nearly two miles high,' added the Queen.

  `Well, I shan't go, at any rate,' said Alice:  `besides,
that's not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.'

  `It's the oldest rule in the book,' said the King.

  `Then it ought to be Number One,' said Alice.

  The King turned pale, and shut his note-book hastily.
`Consider your verdict,' he said to the jury, in a low, trembling
voice.

  `There's more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty,' said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry; `this paper has
just been picked up.'

  `What's in it?' said the Queen.

  `I haven't opened it yet,' said the White Rabbit, `but it seems
to be a letter, written by the prisoner to--to somebody.'

  `It must have been that,' said the King, `unless it was
written to nobody, which isn't usual, you know.'

  `Who is it directed to?' said one of the jurymen.

  `It isn't directed at all,' said the White Rabbit; `in fact,
there's nothing written on the OUTSIDE.'  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke, and added `It isn't a letter, after all:  it's a set
of verses.'

  `Are they in the prisoner's handwriting?' asked another of
the jurymen.

  `No, they're not,' said the White Rabbit, `and that's the
queerest thing about it.'  (The jury all looked puzzled.)

  `He must have imitated somebody else's hand,' said the King.
(The jury all brightened up again.)

  `Please your Majesty,' said the Knave, `I didn't write it, and
they can't prove I did:  there's no name signed at the end.'

  `If you didn't sign it,' said the King, `that only makes the
matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else you'd
have signed your name like an honest man.'

  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day.

  `That PROVES his guilt,' said the Queen.

  `It proves nothing of the sort!' said Alice.  `Why, you don't
even know what they're about!'

  `Read them,' said the King.

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  `Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty?' he asked.

  `Begin at the beginning,' the King said gravely, `and go on
till you come to the end:  then stop.'

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:--

        `They told me you had been to her,
          And mentioned me to him:
        She gave me a good character,
          But said I could not swim.

        He sent them word I had not gone
          (We know it to be true):
        If she should push the matter on,
          What would become of you?

        I gave her one, they gave him two,
          You gave us three or more;
        They all returned from him to you,
          Though they were mine before.

        If I or she should chance to be
          Involved in this affair,
        He trusts to you to set them free,
          Exactly as we were.

        My notion was that you had been
          (Before she had this fit)
        An obstacle that came between
          Him, and ourselves, and it.

        Don't let him know she liked them best,
          For this must ever be
        A secret, kept from all the rest,
          Between yourself and me.'

  `That's the most important piece of evidence we've heard yet,'
said the King, rubbing his hands; `so now let the jury--'

  `If any one of them can explain it,' said Alice, (she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasn't a bit
afraid of interrupting him,) `I'll give him sixpence.  _I_ don't
believe there's an atom of meaning in it.'

  The jury all wrote down on their slates, `SHE doesn't believe
there's an atom of meaning in it,' but none of them attempted to
explain the paper.

  `If there's no meaning in it,' said the King, `that saves a
world of trouble, you know, as we needn't try to find any.  And
yet I don't know,' he went on, spreading out the verses on his
knee, and looking at them with one eye; `I seem to see some
meaning in them, after all.  "--SAID I COULD NOT SWIM--" you
can't swim, can you?' he added, turning to the Knave.

  The Knave shook his head sadly.  `Do I look like it?' he said.
(Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.)

  `All right, so far,' said the King, and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself:  `"WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE--" that's
the jury, of course-- "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO--" why,
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know--'

  `But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU,"' said
Alice.

  `Why, there they are!' said the King triumphantly, pointing to
the tarts on the table.  `Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again--"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT--"  you never had fits, my
dear, I think?' he said to the Queen.

  `Never!' said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke.  (The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)

  `Then the words don't FIT you,' said the King, looking round
the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.

  `It's a pun!' the King added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, `Let the jury consider their verdict,' the
King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

  `No, no!' said the Queen.  `Sentence first--verdict afterwards.'

  `Stuff and nonsense!' said Alice loudly.  `The idea of having
the sentence first!'

  `Hold your tongue!' said the Queen, turning purple.

  `I won't!' said Alice.

  `Off with her head!' the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
Nobody moved.

  `Who cares for you?' said Alice, (she had grown to her full
size by this time.)  `You're nothing but a pack of cards!'

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face.

  `Wake up, Alice dear!' said her sister; `Why, what a long
sleep you've had!'

  `Oh, I've had such a curious dream!' said Alice, and she told
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about; and
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, `It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea; it's
getting late.'  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:--

  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hers--she could hear the very tones of her
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyes--and
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sister's dream.

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
by--the frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring pool--she could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their never-ending meal,
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to execution--once more the pig-baby was sneezing on the
Duchess's knee, while plates and dishes crashed around it--once
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizard's
slate-pencil, and the choking of the suppressed guinea-pigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.

  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull reality--the grass would be only
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reeds--the rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep-
bells, and the Queen's shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boy--and the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
all the other queer noises, would change (she knew) to the
confused clamour of the busy farm-yard--while the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtle's
heavy sobs.

  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would, in the after-time, be herself a grown woman; and how
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own child-life, and the happy summer days.

                             THE END


Culture is an umbrella term which encompasses the social behavior and norms found in human societies, as well as the knowledge, beliefs, arts, laws, customs, capabilities and habits of the individuals in these groups.[1]

Humans acquire culture through the learning processes of enculturation and socialization, which is shown by the diversity of cultures across societies.

A cultural norm codifies acceptable conduct in society; it serves as guideline for behavior, dress, language, and demeanor in a situation, which serves as a template for expectations in a social group. Accepting only a monoculture in a social group can bear risks, just as a single species can wither in the face of environmental change, for lack of functional responses to the change.[2] Thus in military culture, valor is counted an ideal behavior for an individual, as are duty, honor, and loyalty to the social group are counted as virtues, or functional responses in the continuum of conflict. In the practice of religion, analogous virtues can be identified in a social group.

Description
Culture is considered a central concept in anthropology, encompassing the range of phenomena that are transmitted through social learning in human societies. Cultural universals are found in all human societies; these include expressive forms like art, music, dance, ritual, religion, and technologies like tool usage, cooking, shelter, and clothing. The concept of material culture covers the physical expressions of culture, such as technology, architecture and art, whereas the immaterial aspects of culture such as principles of social organization (including practices of political organization and social institutions), mythology, philosophy, literature (both written and oral), and science comprise the intangible cultural heritage of a society.[3]

In the humanities, one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in the arts, sciences, education, or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been used to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies. Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low culture, popular culture, or folk culture of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the symbolic markers used by ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as body modification, clothing or jewelry. Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture that emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as Marxism and critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the lower classes and create a false consciousness, and such perspectives are common in the discipline of cultural studies. In the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in evolved biological dispositions.

When used as a count noun, a "culture" is the set of customs, traditions, and values of a society or community, such as an ethnic group or nation. Culture is the set of knowledge acquired over time. In this sense, multiculturalism values the peaceful coexistence and mutual respect between different cultures inhabiting the same planet. Sometimes "culture" is also used to describe specific practices within a subgroup of a society, a subculture (e.g. "bro culture"), or a counterculture. Within cultural anthropology, the ideology and analytical stance of cultural relativism holds that cultures cannot easily be objectively ranked or evaluated because any evaluation is necessarily situated within the value system of a given culture.

Etymology
The modern term "culture" is based on a term used by the Ancient Roman orator Cicero in his Tusculanae Disputationes, where he wrote of a cultivation of the soul or "cultura animi,"[4] using an agricultural metaphor for the development of a philosophical soul, understood teleologically as the highest possible ideal for human development. Samuel Pufendorf took over this metaphor in a modern context, meaning something similar, but no longer assuming that philosophy was man's natural perfection. His use, and that of many writers after him, "refers to all the ways in which human beings overcome their original barbarism, and through artifice, become fully human."[5]

In 1986, philosopher Edward S. Casey wrote, "The very word culture meant 'place tilled' in Middle English, and the same word goes back to Latin colere, 'to inhabit, care for, till, worship' and cultus, 'A cult, especially a religious one.' To be cultural, to have a culture, is to inhabit a place sufficiently intensive to cultivate it—to be responsible for it, to respond to it, to attend to it caringly."[6]

Culture described by Richard Velkley:[5]

... originally meant the cultivation of the soul or mind, acquires most of its later modern meaning in the writings of the 18th-century German thinkers, who were on various levels developing Rousseau's criticism of "modern liberalism and Enlightenment". Thus a contrast between "culture" and "civilization" is usually implied in these authors, even when not expressed as such.

In the words of anthropologist E.B. Tylor, it is "that complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."[7] Alternatively, in a contemporary variant, "Culture is defined as a social domain that emphasizes the practices, discourses and material expressions, which, over time, express the continuities and discontinuities of social meaning of a life held in common.[8]

The Cambridge English Dictionary states that culture is "the way of life, especially the general customs and beliefs, of a particular group of people at a particular time."[9] Terror management theory posits that culture is a series of activities and worldviews that provide humans with the basis for perceiving themselves as "person[s] of worth within the world of meaning"—raising themselves above the merely physical aspects of existence, in order to deny the animal insignificance and death that Homo sapiens became aware of when they acquired a larger brain.[10][11]

The word is used in a general sense as the evolved ability to categorize and represent experiences with symbols and to act imaginatively and creatively. This ability arose with the evolution of behavioral modernity in humans around 50,000 years ago, and is often thought to be unique to humans, although some other species have demonstrated similar, though much less complex, abilities for social learning. It is also used to denote the complex networks of practices and accumulated knowledge and ideas that is transmitted through social interaction and exist in specific human groups, or cultures, using the plural form.

It has been estimated from archaeological data that the human capacity for cumulative culture emerged somewhere between 500,000–170,000 years ago.[12]

Raimon Panikkar identified 29 ways in which cultural change can be brought about, including growth, development, evolution, involution, renovation, reconception, reform, innovation, revivalism, revolution, mutation, progress, diffusion, osmosis, borrowing, eclecticism, syncretism, modernization, indigenization, and transformation.[13] In this context, modernization could be viewed as adoption of Enlightenment era beliefs and practices, such as science, rationalism, industry, commerce, democracy, and the notion of progress. Rein Raud, building on the work of Umberto Eco, Pierre Bourdieu and Jeffrey C. Alexander, has proposed a model of cultural change based on claims and bids, which are judged by their cognitive adequacy and endorsed or not endorsed by the symbolic authority of the cultural community in question.[14]

Cultural invention has come to mean any innovation that is new and found to be useful to a group of people and expressed in their behavior but which does not exist as a physical object. Humanity is in a global "accelerating culture change period," driven by the expansion of international commerce, the mass media, and above all, the human population explosion, among other factors. Culture repositioning means the reconstruction of the cultural concept of a society.[15]

Cultures are internally affected by both forces encouraging change and forces resisting change. These forces are related to both social structures and natural events, and are involved in the perpetuation of cultural ideas and practices within current structures, which themselves are subject to change.[16] (See structuration.)

Social conflict and the development of technologies can produce changes within a society by altering social dynamics and promoting new cultural models, and spurring or enabling generative action. These social shifts may accompany ideological shifts and other types of cultural change. For example, the U.S. feminist movement involved new practices that produced a shift in gender relations, altering both gender and economic structures. Environmental conditions may also enter as factors. For example, after tropical forests returned at the end of the last ice age, plants suitable for domestication were available, leading to the invention of agriculture, which in turn brought about many cultural innovations and shifts in social dynamics.[17]

Cultures are externally affected via contact between societies, which may also produce—or inhibit—social shifts and changes in cultural practices. War or competition over resources may impact technological development or social dynamics. Additionally, cultural ideas may transfer from one society to another, through diffusion or acculturation. In diffusion, the form of something (though not necessarily its meaning) moves from one culture to another. For example, Western restaurant chains and culinary brands sparked curiosity and fascination to the Chinese as China opened its economy to international trade in the late 20th-century.[18] "Stimulus diffusion" (the sharing of ideas) refers to an element of one culture leading to an invention or propagation in another. "Direct borrowing," on the other hand, tends to refer to technological or tangible diffusion from one culture to another. Diffusion of innovations theory presents a research-based model of why and when individuals and cultures adopt new ideas, practices, and products.

Acculturation has different meanings, but in this context it refers to replacement of the traits of one culture with those of another, such as what happened to certain Native American tribes and to many indigenous peoples across the globe during the process of colonization. Related processes on an individual level include assimilation (adoption of a different culture by an individual) and transculturation. The transnational flow of culture has played a major role in merging different culture and sharing thoughts, ideas, and beliefs.

Immanuel Kant (1724–1804) formulated an individualist definition of "enlightenment" similar to the concept of bildung: "Enlightenment is man's emergence from his self-incurred immaturity."[19] He argued that this immaturity comes not from a lack of understanding, but from a lack of courage to think independently. Against this intellectual cowardice, Kant urged: Sapere aude, "Dare to be wise!" In reaction to Kant, German scholars such as Johann Gottfried Herder (1744–1803) argued that human creativity, which necessarily takes unpredictable and highly diverse forms, is as important as human rationality. Moreover, Herder proposed a collective form of bildung: "For Herder, Bildung was the totality of experiences that provide a coherent identity, and sense of common destiny, to a people."[20]

In 1795, the Prussian linguist and philosopher Wilhelm von Humboldt (1767–1835) called for an anthropology that would synthesize Kant's and Herder's interests. During the Romantic era, scholars in Germany, especially those concerned with nationalist movements—such as the nationalist struggle to create a "Germany" out of diverse principalities, and the nationalist struggles by ethnic minorities against the Austro-Hungarian Empire—developed a more inclusive notion of culture as "worldview" (Weltanschauung).[21] According to this school of thought, each ethnic group has a distinct worldview that is incommensurable with the worldviews of other groups. Although more inclusive than earlier views, this approach to culture still allowed for distinctions between "civilized" and "primitive" or "tribal" cultures.

In 1860, Adolf Bastian (1826–1905) argued for "the psychic unity of mankind."[22] He proposed that a scientific comparison of all human societies would reveal that distinct worldviews consisted of the same basic elements. According to Bastian, all human societies share a set of "elementary ideas" (Elementargedanken); different cultures, or different "folk ideas" (Völkergedanken), are local modifications of the elementary ideas.[23] This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture. Franz Boas (1858–1942) was trained in this tradition, and he brought it with him when he left Germany for the United States.[24]

In the 19th century, humanists such as English poet and essayist Matthew Arnold (1822–1888) used the word "culture" to refer to an ideal of individual human refinement, of "the best that has been thought and said in the world."[25] This concept of culture is also comparable to the German concept of bildung: "...culture being a pursuit of our total perfection by means of getting to know, on all the matters which most concern us, the best which has been thought and said in the world."[25]

In practice, culture referred to an elite ideal and was associated with such activities as art, classical music, and haute cuisine.[26] As these forms were associated with urban life, "culture" was identified with "civilization" (from lat. civitas, city). Another facet of the Romantic movement was an interest in folklore, which led to identifying a "culture" among non-elites. This distinction is often characterized as that between high culture, namely that of the ruling social group, and low culture. In other words, the idea of "culture" that developed in Europe during the 18th and early 19th centuries reflected inequalities within European societies.[27]

Matthew Arnold contrasted "culture" with anarchy; other Europeans, following philosophers Thomas Hobbes and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, contrasted "culture" with "the state of nature." According to Hobbes and Rousseau, the Native Americans who were being conquered by Europeans from the 16th centuries on were living in a state of nature[citation needed]; this opposition was expressed through the contrast between "civilized" and "uncivilized." According to this way of thinking, one could classify some countries and nations as more civilized than others and some people as more cultured than others. This contrast led to Herbert Spencer's theory of Social Darwinism and Lewis Henry Morgan's theory of cultural evolution. Just as some critics have argued that the distinction between high and low cultures is really an expression of the conflict between European elites and non-elites, other critics have argued that the distinction between civilized and uncivilized people is really an expression of the conflict between European colonial powers and their colonial subjects.

Other 19th-century critics, following Rousseau, have accepted this differentiation between higher and lower culture, but have seen the refinement and sophistication of high culture as corrupting and unnatural developments that obscure and distort people's essential nature. These critics considered folk music (as produced by "the folk," i.e., rural, illiterate, peasants) to honestly express a natural way of life, while classical music seemed superficial and decadent. Equally, this view often portrayed indigenous peoples as "noble savages" living authentic and unblemished lives, uncomplicated and uncorrupted by the highly stratified capitalist systems of the West.

In 1870 the anthropologist Edward Tylor (1832–1917) applied these ideas of higher versus lower culture to propose a theory of the evolution of religion. According to this theory, religion evolves from more polytheistic to more monotheistic forms.[28] In the process, he redefined culture as a diverse set of activities characteristic of all human societies. This view paved the way for the modern understanding of culture.

Although anthropologists worldwide refer to Tylor's definition of culture,[29] in the 20th century "culture" emerged as the central and unifying concept of American anthropology, where it most commonly refers to the universal human capacity to classify and encode human experiences symbolically, and to communicate symbolically encoded experiences socially.[citation needed] American anthropology is organized into four fields, each of which plays an important role in research on culture: biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, cultural anthropology, and in the United States, archaeology.[30][31][32][33] The term Kulturbrille, or "culture glasses," coined by German American anthropologist Franz Boas, refers to the "lenses" through which we see our own countries. Martin Lindstrom asserts that Kulturbrille, which allow us to make sense of the culture we inhabit, also "can blind us to things outsiders pick up immediately."[34]

The sociology of culture concerns culture as manifested in society. For sociologist Georg Simmel (1858–1918), culture referred to "the cultivation of individuals through the agency of external forms which have been objectified in the course of history."[35] As such, culture in the sociological field can be defined as the ways of thinking, the ways of acting, and the material objects that together shape a people's way of life. Culture can be any of two types, non-material culture or material culture.[3] Non-material culture refers to the non-physical ideas that individuals have about their culture, including values, belief systems, rules, norms, morals, language, organizations, and institutions, while material culture is the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make or have made. The term tends to be relevant only in archeological and anthropological studies, but it specifically means all material evidence which can be attributed to culture, past or present.

Cultural sociology first emerged in Weimar Germany (1918–1933), where sociologists such as Alfred Weber used the term Kultursoziologie (cultural sociology). Cultural sociology was then "reinvented" in the English-speaking world as a product of the "cultural turn" of the 1960s, which ushered in structuralist and postmodern approaches to social science. This type of cultural sociology may be loosely regarded as an approach incorporating cultural analysis and critical theory. Cultural sociologists tend to reject scientific methods, instead hermeneutically focusing on words, artifacts and symbols.[36] "Culture" has since become an important concept across many branches of sociology, including resolutely scientific fields like social stratification and social network analysis. As a result, there has been a recent influx of quantitative sociologists to the field. Thus, there is now a growing group of sociologists of culture who are, confusingly, not cultural sociologists. These scholars reject the abstracted postmodern aspects of cultural sociology, and instead look for a theoretical backing in the more scientific vein of social psychology and cognitive science.[citation needed]

Early researchers and development of cultural sociology
The sociology of culture grew from the intersection between sociology (as shaped by early theorists like Marx,[37] Durkheim, and Weber) with the growing discipline of anthropology, wherein researchers pioneered ethnographic strategies for describing and analyzing a variety of cultures around the world. Part of the legacy of the early development of the field lingers in the methods (much of cultural sociological research is qualitative), in the theories (a variety of critical approaches to sociology are central to current research communities), and in the substantive focus of the field. For instance, relationships between popular culture, political control, and social class were early and lasting concerns in the field.

Cultural studies
In the United Kingdom, sociologists and other scholars influenced by Marxism such as Stuart Hall (1932–2014) and Raymond Williams (1921–1988) developed cultural studies. Following nineteenth-century Romantics, they identified "culture" with consumption goods and leisure activities (such as art, music, film, food, sports, and clothing). They saw patterns of consumption and leisure as determined by relations of production, which led them to focus on class relations and the organization of production.[38][39]

In the United States, cultural studies focuses largely on the study of popular culture; that is, on the social meanings of mass-produced consumer and leisure goods. Richard Hoggart coined the term in 1964 when he founded the Birmingham Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies or CCCS.[40] It has since become strongly associated with Stuart Hall,[41] who succeeded Hoggart as Director.[42] Cultural studies in this sense, then, can be viewed as a limited concentration scoped on the intricacies of consumerism, which belongs to a wider culture sometimes referred to as "Western civilization" or "globalism."

From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed, it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies, and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[43] Cultural studies is concerned with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. It also studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to "fit in" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice.

In the context of cultural studies, the idea of a text includes not only written language, but also films, photographs, fashion or hairstyles: the texts of cultural studies comprise all the meaningful artifacts of culture.[44] Similarly, the discipline widens the concept of "culture." "Culture" for a cultural-studies researcher not only includes traditional high culture (the culture of ruling social groups)[45] and popular culture, but also everyday meanings and practices. The last two, in fact, have become the main focus of cultural studies. A further and recent approach is comparative cultural studies, based on the disciplines of comparative literature and cultural studies.[46]

Scholars in the United Kingdom and the United States developed somewhat different versions of cultural studies after the late 1970s. The British version of cultural studies had originated in the 1950s and 1960s, mainly under the influence of Richard Hoggart, E.P. Thompson, and Raymond Williams, and later that of Stuart Hall and others at the Centre for Contemporary Cultural Studies at the University of Birmingham. This included overtly political, left-wing views, and criticisms of popular culture as "capitalist" mass culture; it absorbed some of the ideas of the Frankfurt School critique of the "culture industry" (i.e. mass culture). This emerges in the writings of early British cultural-studies scholars and their influences: see the work of (for example) Raymond Williams, Stuart Hall, Paul Willis, and Paul Gilroy.

In the United States, Lindlof and Taylor write, "Cultural studies [were] grounded in a pragmatic, liberal-pluralist tradition."[47] The American version of cultural studies initially concerned itself more with understanding the subjective and appropriative side of audience reactions to, and uses of, mass culture; for example, American cultural-studies advocates wrote about the liberatory aspects of fandom.[citation needed] The distinction between American and British strands, however, has faded.[citation needed] Some researchers, especially in early British cultural studies, apply a Marxist model to the field. This strain of thinking has some influence from the Frankfurt School, but especially from the structuralist Marxism of Louis Althusser and others. The main focus of an orthodox Marxist approach concentrates on the production of meaning. This model assumes a mass production of culture and identifies power as residing with those producing cultural artifacts. In a Marxist view, the mode and relations of production form the economic base of society, which constantly interacts and influences superstructures, such as culture.[48] Other approaches to cultural studies, such as feminist cultural studies and later American developments of the field, distance themselves from this view. They criticize the Marxist assumption of a single, dominant meaning, shared by all, for any cultural product. The non-Marxist approaches suggest that different ways of consuming cultural artifacts affect the meaning of the product. This view comes through in the book Doing Cultural Studies: The Story of the Sony Walkman (by Paul du Gay et al.),[49] which seeks to challenge the notion that those who produce commodities control the meanings that people attribute to them. Feminist cultural analyst, theorist, and art historian Griselda Pollock contributed to cultural studies from viewpoints of art history and psychoanalysis. The writer Julia Kristeva is among influential voices at the turn of the century, contributing to cultural studies from the field of art and psychoanalytical French feminism.[50]

Petrakis and Kostis (2013) divide cultural background variables into two main groups:[51]

The first group covers the variables that represent the "efficiency orientation" of the societies: performance orientation, future orientation, assertiveness, power distance and uncertainty avoidance.
The second covers the variables that represent the "social orientation" of societies, i.e., the attitudes and lifestyles of their members. These variables include gender egalitarianism, institutional collectivism, in-group collectivism and human orientation.
In 2016, a new approach to culture was suggested by Rein Raud,[14] who defines culture as the sum of resources available to human beings for making sense of their world and proposes a two-tiered approach, combining the study of texts (all reified meanings in circulation) and cultural practices (all repeatable actions that involve the production, dissemination or transmission of meanings), thus making it possible to re-link anthropological and sociological study of culture with the tradition of textual theory.

Starting from the 1990s,[52]:31 psychological research on culture influence is growing and challenges the universality assumed in general psychology.[53]:158–168[54] Culture psychologists try to answer whether the human mind is independent from culture. Some study explores the relationship between emotions and culture. For example, people from collectivistic culture, like Japanese, suppress their positive emotions more than their American counterpart.[55] Culture may affect people emotional experience and expression. On the other hand, some researcher try to look for differences of people's personality across culture.[56][57] As different culture dictate distinctive norms, culture shock is also studied to understand how people react when they are confronted with another culture. Besides, cognitive tools may not accessible or function differently cross culture.[52]:19 Raised from a culture without abacus trained people with distinctive reasoning style.[58] Or, cultural lens may make people view the same outcome of events differently. Western are motivated for their success experience. In contrast, failures motivate East Asian to work even harder than success.[59] Culture is important for psychologists to consider when understanding the human mental operation.

Tourism

Tourism is travel for pleasure or business; also the theory and practice of touring, the business of attracting, accommodating, and entertaining tourists, and the business of operating tours.[2] The World Tourism Organization defines tourism more generally, in terms which go "beyond the common perception of tourism as being limited to holiday activity only", as people "traveling to and staying in places outside their usual environment for not more than one consecutive year for leisure and not less than 24 hours, business and other purposes".[3]

Tourism can be domestic (within the traveller's own country) or international, and international tourism has both incoming and outgoing implications on a country's balance of payments.

Tourism numbers declined as a result of a strong economic slowdown (the late-2000s recession) between the second half of 2008 and the end of 2009, and in consequence of the outbreak of the 2009 H1N1 influenza virus,[4][5] but slowly recovered. Globally, international tourism receipts (the travel item in balance of payments) grew to US$1.03 trillion (€740 billion) in 2005, corresponding to an increase in real terms of 3.8% from 2010.[6] International tourist arrivals surpassed the milestone of 1 billion tourists globally for the first time in 2012,[7] emerging source markets such as China, Russia, and Brazil had significantly increased their spending over the previous decade.[8] The ITB Berlin is the world's leading tourism trade-fair.[9][better source needed] Global tourism accounts for c. 8% of global greenhouse-gas emissions.[10]

The word tourist was used in 1772[11] and tourism in 1811.[12] It is formed from the word tour, which is derived from Old English turian, from Old French torner, from Latin tornare; 'to turn on a lathe,' which is itself from Ancient Greek tornos (τόρνος); 'lathe'.[13]

The tourism industry, as part of the service sector,[14] has become an important source of income for many regions and even for entire countries. The Manila Declaration on World Tourism of 1980 recognized its importance as "an activity essential to the life of nations because of its direct effects on the social, cultural, educational, and economic sectors of national societies, and on their international relations."[3][15]

Tourism brings large amounts of income into a local economy in the form of payment for goods and services needed by tourists, accounting as of 2011 for 30% of the world's trade in services, and, as an invisible export, for 6% of overall exports of goods and services.[6] It also generates opportunities for employment in the service sector of the economy associated with tourism.[16]

The hospitality industries which benefit from tourism include transportation services (such as airlines, cruise ships, trains and taxicabs); lodging (including hotels, hostels, homestays, resorts and renting out rooms); and entertainment venues (such as amusement parks, restaurants, casinos, shopping malls, music venues, and theatres). This is in addition to goods bought by tourists, including souvenirs.

On the flip-side, tourism can degrade people[17] and sour relationships between host and guest.[18]

In 1936, the League of Nations defined a foreign tourist as "someone traveling abroad for at least twenty-four hours". Its successor, the United Nations, amended this definition in 1945, by including a maximum stay of six months.[19]

In 1941, Hunziker and Kraft defined tourism as "the sum of the phenomena and relationships arising from the travel and stay of non-residents, insofar as they do not lead to permanent residence and are not connected with any earning activity."[20][21] In 1976, the Tourism Society of England's definition was: "Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes."[22] In 1981, the International Association of Scientific Experts in Tourism defined tourism in terms of particular activities chosen and undertaken outside the home.[23]

In 1994, the United Nations identified three forms of tourism in its Recommendations on Tourism Statistics:[24]

Domestic tourism, involving residents of the given country traveling only within this country
Inbound tourism,[25] involving non-residents traveling in the given country
Outbound tourism, involving residents traveling in another country
The terms tourism and travel are sometimes used interchangeably. In this context, travel has a similar definition to tourism but implies a more purposeful journey. The terms tourism and tourist are sometimes used pejoratively, to imply a shallow interest in the cultures or locations visited. By contrast, traveler is often used as a sign of distinction. The sociology of tourism has studied the cultural values underpinning these distinctions and their implications for class relations.[26]

Total volume of cross-border tourist travel
International tourist arrivals reached 1.035 billion in 2012, up from over 996 million in 2011, and 952 million in 2010.[7] In 2011 and 2012, international travel demand continued to recover from the losses resulting from the late-2000s recession, where tourism suffered a strong slowdown from the second half of 2008 through the end of 2009. After a 5% increase in the first half of 2008, growth in international tourist arrivals moved into negative territory in the second half of 2008, and ended up only 2% for the year, compared to a 7% increase in 2007.[4] The negative trend intensified during 2009, exacerbated in some countries due to the outbreak of the H1N1 influenza virus, resulting in a worldwide decline of 4.2% in 2009 to 880 million international tourists arrivals, and a 5.7% decline in international tourism receipts.[5]

Antiquity
See also: Travel literature
Travel outside a person's local area for leisure was largely confined to wealthy classes, who at times traveled to distant parts of the world, to see great buildings and works of art, learn new languages, experience new cultures, and to taste different cuisines. As early as Shulgi, however, kings praised themselves for protecting roads and building way stations for travelers.[35] Travelling for pleasure can be seen in Egypt as early on as 1500 BC.[36] During the Roman Republic, spas and coastal resorts such as Baiae were popular among the rich. Pausanias wrote his Description of Greece in the second century AD. In ancient China, nobles sometimes made a point of visiting Mount Tai and, on occasion, all five Sacred Mountains.

Middle Ages
By the Middle Ages, Christianity and Buddhism and Islam had traditions of pilgrimage. Chaucer's Canterbury Tales and Wu Cheng'en's Journey to the West remain classics of English and Chinese literature.

The 10th- to 13th-century Song dynasty also saw secular travel writers such as Su Shi (11th century) and Fan Chengda (12th century) become popular in China. Under the Ming, Xu Xiake continued the practice.[37] In medieval Italy, Francesco Petrarch also wrote an allegorical account of his 1336 ascent of Mount Ventoux that praised the act of traveling and criticized frigida incuriositas ("cold lack of curiosity"). The Burgundian poet Michault Taillevent [fr] later composed his own horrified recollections of a 1430 trip through the Jura Mountains.[38]

Modern tourism can be traced to what was known as the Grand Tour, which was a traditional trip around Europe (especially Germany and Italy), undertaken by mainly upper-class European young men of means, mainly from Western and Northern European countries. In 1624, young Prince of Poland, Ladislaus Sigismund Vasa, the eldest son of Sigismund III, embarked for a journey across Europe, as was in custom among Polish nobility.[39] He travelled through territories of today's Germany, Belgium, Netherlands, where he admired the Siege of Breda by Spanish forces, France, Switzerland to Italy, Austria, and the Czech Republic.[39] It was an educational journey[40] and one of the outcomes was introduction of Italian opera in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth.[41]

The custom flourished from about 1660 until the advent of large-scale rail transit in the 1840s and generally followed a standard itinerary. It was an educational opportunity and rite of passage. Though primarily associated with the British nobility and wealthy landed gentry, similar trips were made by wealthy young men of Protestant Northern European nations on the Continent, and from the second half of the 18th century some South American, US, and other overseas youth joined in. The tradition was extended to include more of the middle class after rail and steamship travel made the journey easier, and Thomas Cook made the "Cook's Tour" a byword.

The Grand Tour became a real status symbol for upper-class students in the 18th and 19th centuries. In this period, Johann Joachim Winckelmann's theories about the supremacy of classic culture became very popular and appreciated in the European academic world. Artists, writers, and travelers (such as Goethe) affirmed the supremacy of classic art of which Italy, France, and Greece provide excellent examples. For these reasons, the Grand Tour's main destinations were to those centers, where upper-class students could find rare examples of classic art and history.

The New York Times recently described the Grand Tour in this way:

Three hundred years ago, wealthy young Englishmen began taking a post-Oxbridge trek through France and Italy in search of art, culture and the roots of Western civilization. With nearly unlimited funds, aristocratic connections and months (or years) to roam, they commissioned paintings, perfected their language skills and mingled with the upper crust of the Continent.

— Gross, Matt., Lessons From the Frugal Grand Tour." New York Times 5 September 2008.
The primary value of the Grand Tour, it was believed, laid in the exposure both to the cultural legacy of classical antiquity and the Renaissance, and to the aristocratic and fashionably polite society of the European continent.

Leisure travel was associated with the Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom – the first European country to promote leisure time to the increasing industrial population.[42] Initially, this applied to the owners of the machinery of production, the economic oligarchy, factory owners and traders. These comprised the new middle class.[42] Cox & Kings was the first official travel company to be formed in 1758.[43]

The British origin of this new industry is reflected in many place names. In Nice, France, one of the first and best-established holiday resorts on the French Riviera, the long esplanade along the seafront is known to this day as the Promenade des Anglais; in many other historic resorts in continental Europe, old, well-established palace hotels have names like the Hotel Bristol, Hotel Carlton, or Hotel Majestic – reflecting the dominance of English customers.

A pioneer of the travel agency business, Thomas Cook's idea to offer excursions came to him while waiting for the stagecoach on the London Road at Kibworth. With the opening of the extended Midland Counties Railway, he arranged to take a group of 540 temperance campaigners from Leicester Campbell Street station to a rally in Loughborough, eleven miles (18 km) away. On 5 July 1841, Thomas Cook arranged for the rail company to charge one shilling per person; this included rail tickets and food for the journey. Cook was paid a share of the fares charged to the passengers, as the railway tickets, being legal contracts between company and passenger, could not have been issued at his own price.[clarification needed] This was the first privately chartered excursion train to be advertised to the general public; Cook himself acknowledged that there had been previous, unadvertised, private excursion trains.[44] During the following three summers he planned and conducted outings for temperance societies and Sunday school children. In 1844 the Midland Counties Railway Company agreed to make a permanent arrangement with him, provided he found the passengers. This success led him to start his own business running rail excursions for pleasure, taking a percentage of the railway fares.[45]

In 1855, he planned his first excursion abroad, when he took a group from Leicester to Calais to coincide with the Paris Exhibition. The following year he started his "grand circular tours" of Europe.[46] During the 1860s he took parties to Switzerland, Italy, Egypt, and the United States. Cook established "inclusive independent travel", whereby the traveler went independently but his agency charged for travel, food, and accommodation for a fixed period over any chosen route. Such was his success that the Scottish railway companies withdrew their support between 1862 and 1863 to try the excursion business for themselves.

Cruising is a popular form of water tourism. Leisure cruise ships were introduced by the Peninsular & Oriental Steam Navigation Company (P&O) in 1844, sailing from Southampton to destinations such as Gibraltar, Malta and Athens.[47] In 1891, German businessman Albert Ballin sailed the ship Augusta Victoria from Hamburg into the Mediterranean Sea. June 29, 1900 saw the launching of the first purpose-built cruise ship was Prinzessin Victoria Luise, built in Hamburg for the Hamburg America Line.[48]

Modern day tourism
Further information: Impacts of tourism
Many leisure-oriented tourists travel to seaside resorts on their nearest coast or further afield. Coastal areas in the tropics are popular in both summer and winter.

Academics have defined mass tourism as travel by groups on pre-scheduled tours, usually under the organization of tourism professionals.[49] This form of tourism developed during the second half of the 19th century in the United Kingdom and was pioneered by Thomas Cook. Cook took advantage of Europe's rapidly expanding railway network and established a company that offered affordable day trip excursions to the masses, in addition to longer holidays to Continental Europe, India, Asia and the Western Hemisphere which attracted wealthier customers. By the 1890s over 20,000 tourists per year used Thomas Cook & Son.[50]

The relationship between tourism companies, transportation operators and hotels is a central feature of mass tourism. Cook was able to offer prices that were below the publicly advertised price because his company purchased large numbers of tickets from railroads.[50] One contemporary form of mass tourism, package tourism, still incorporates the partnership between these three groups.

Travel developed during the early 20th century and was facilitated by the development of the automobiles and later by airplanes. Improvements in transport allowed many people to travel quickly to places of leisure interest so that more people could begin to enjoy the benefits of leisure time.

In Continental Europe, early seaside resorts included: Heiligendamm, founded in 1793 at the Baltic Sea, being the first seaside resort; Ostend, popularised by the people of Brussels; Boulogne-sur-Mer and Deauville for the Parisians; Taormina in Sicily. In the United States, the first seaside resorts in the European style were at Atlantic City, New Jersey and Long Island, New York.

By the mid-20th century, the Mediterranean Coast became the principal mass tourism destination. The 1960s and 1970s saw mass tourism play a major role in the Spanish economic "miracle".

Niche tourism refers to the numerous specialty forms of tourism that have emerged over the years, each with its own adjective. Many of these terms have come into common use by the tourism industry and academics.[51] Others are emerging concepts that may or may not gain popular usage. Examples of the more common niche tourism markets are:

St. Moritz, Switzerland became the cradle of the developing winter tourism in the 1860s: hotel manager Johannes Badrutt invited some summer guests from England to return in the winter to see the snowy landscape, thereby inaugurating a popular trend.[52][53] It was, however, only in the 1970s when winter tourism took over the lead from summer tourism in many of the Swiss ski resorts. Even in winter, up to one third of all guests (depending on the location) consist of non-skiers.[54]

Major ski resorts are located mostly in the various European countries (e.g. Andorra, Austria, Bulgaria, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Iceland, Italy, Norway, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Serbia, Sweden, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey), Canada, the United States (e.g. Montana, Utah, Colorado, California, Wyoming, Vermont, New Hampshire, New York) Argentina, New Zealand, Japan, South Korea, Chile, and Lebanon.

Some places that already have ski opportunities can also have glaciers in the area. Some of these places that already offer a glacier hike to see these glaciers. One of these places is New Zealand; New Zealand has several glaciers that are available for this experience. The Franz Josef is one of these glaciers that tourism is available. The only way to get to the glacier is via a helicopter. Before helicopters were invented, the way that people were able to get up to the glacier was by hiking up to the glacier. The companies have to make sure that people are safe when they are on the glacier.[55] This would fall under environmental tourism as well as winter tourism.[56] Visits to New Zealand require an eTA from 1 October 2019 which is available online.[57][58]

There has been an up-trend in tourism over the last few decades,[vague] especially in Europe, where international travel for short breaks is common. Tourists have a wide range of budgets and tastes, and a wide variety of resorts and hotels have developed to cater for them. For example, some people prefer simple beach vacations, while others want more specialized holidays, quieter resorts, family-oriented holidays, or niche market-targeted destination hotels.

The developments in air transport infrastructure, such as jumbo jets, low-cost airlines, and more accessible airports have made many types of tourism more affordable. The WHO estimated in 2009 that there are around half a million people on board aircraft at any given time.[59] There have also been changes in lifestyle, for example, some retirement-age people sustain year-round tourism. This is facilitated by internet sales of tourist services. Some sites have now started to offer dynamic packaging, in which an inclusive price is quoted for a tailor-made package requested by the customer upon impulse.

There have been a few setbacks in tourism, such as the September 11 attacks and terrorist threats to tourist destinations, such as in Bali and several European cities. Also, on 26 December 2004, a tsunami, caused by the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, hit the Asian countries on the Indian Ocean, including the Maldives. Thousands of lives were lost including many tourists. This, together with the vast clean-up operations, stopped or severely hampered tourism in the area for a time.[60]

Individual low-price or even zero-price overnight stays have become more popular in the 2000s, especially with a strong growth in the hostel market and services like CouchSurfing and airbnb being established.[61] There has also been examples of jurisdictions wherein a significant portion of GDP is being spent on altering the primary sources of revenue towards tourism, as has occurred for instance in Dubai.[62]

Sustainable tourism
Main article: Sustainable tourism
"Sustainable tourism is envisaged as leading to management of all resources in such a way that economic, social and aesthetic needs can be fulfilled while maintaining cultural integrity, essential ecological processes, biological diversity and life support systems." (World Tourism Organization)[63]

Sustainable development implies "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs." (World Commission on Environment and Development, 1987)[64]

An important part of sustainable tourism is something known as the three pillars of sustainability which include Economic, Environmental/Ecological and Socio-cultural. For a destination to be truly sustainable it must have an equal balance among the three pillars. Economic is in relation to money and making and maintaining a certain amount of cash. Environmental is of course in relation to the environment it looks into whether the local ecosystems can support the influx of visitors and also how these visitors affect the ecosystem. Then finally Socio-cultural is about how well the culture of this area is able to maintain its traditions with the incoming tourists. These pillars are important because they are the true key to being sustainable when discussing tourism.[56]

Sustainable tourism can be seen as having regard to ecological and social-cultural carrying capacities and includes involving the community of the destination in tourism development planning (that was done e.g. in Fruška Gora National Park in Serbia[65]). It also involves integrating tourism to match current economic and growth policies so as to mitigate some of the negative economic and social impacts of 'mass tourism'. Murphy (1985) advocates the use of an 'ecological approach', to consider both 'plants' and 'people' when implementing the sustainable tourism development process. This is in contrast to the 'boosterism' and 'economic' approaches to tourism planning, neither of which consider the detrimental ecological or sociological impacts of tourism development to a destination.

However, Butler questions the exposition of the term 'sustainable' in the context of tourism, citing its ambiguity and stating that "the emerging sustainable development philosophy of the 1990s can be viewed as an extension of the broader realization that a preoccupation with economic growth without regard to its social and environmental consequences is self-defeating in the long term." Thus 'sustainable tourism development' is seldom considered as an autonomous function of economic regeneration as separate from general economic growth.

Textile tourism
Textile Tourism or Fabric Tourism refers to, people traveling to experience the places related to textile & fabrics, are provided the knowledge on different fabrics,and it`s process, practices of weaving and to know about the technicalities involved and about the rural handicraft of hand-loom, and it involves traveling to experience the historical places of textile-like Jaipur, Mysore, Varanasi, Kancheepuram & so on.[66][67][68][69] [70]

Ecotourism
Main article: Ecotourism
Ecotourism, also known as ecological tourism, is responsible travel to fragile, pristine, and usually protected areas that strives to be low-impact and (often) small-scale. It helps educate the traveler; provides funds for conservation; directly benefits the economic development and political empowerment of local communities, and fosters respect for different cultures and for human rights.Take only memories and leave only footprints is a very common slogan in protected areas.[71] Tourist destinations are shifting to low carbon emissions following the trend of visitors more focused in being environmentally responsible adopting a sustainable behavior.[72]

Movie tourism
The movie tourism is a form of tourism for those who visit the film and television locations, i.e. the places used for filming a film or a television series. In addition to organized tours (and not) to film locations lately has widened the tendency to a type of tourism, linked to the cinema, which relates to events, conventions and more like the case of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico.

Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico
The Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is an artistic costume movement originally born as a journalistic column on various online and paper publications officially in 2012 (with a genesis formed in the previous decade) but, in the following years, it has become a real costume fashion popularized in sites, associations, institutions, municipal administrations, political parties, movements and television listings all over the world. It also includes Museums and Sports Groups linked to its brand. The purpose of the work is varied: from the redevelopment of territorial areas thanks to the artistic interest raised to be film and fiction locations (Movie tourism) to promote events linked to the Cinema as film anniversaries, festivals, parties to theme (Toga Party, Monster Party, Cosplay Party, Hollywood Party, Pajama Party, etc.), manifestations born in films or that the cinema has helped to divulge (though already existing) as, for example, the Demolition Derby, village festivals disseminated by the Cinema (such as those appearing in the Mondo Cane film series, etc.). We wanted to differentiate from Movie Tourism (a fashion that has existed for several decades) to be more varied and not limited to tourism (that is a part of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico). In the mid-2000s, the student of video advertising and journalistic communications at the Turin branch of the Fellini Institute Davide Lingua (called Dave Lingua), of Verolengo, obsessed with customary phenomena, has in mind to create a totally new object to redevelop areas territories hit by the crisis but fun and that leads to fashion accessible to all. This is the genesis for the creation of the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico. A few years later (between 2010, the beginning of the collaboration, and 2012) creates with this name a column (which initially deals with Cine tourism, Cinema Museums and Costume Party with a cinematic theme) within the site (in that period related to the homonymous paper magazine) of the Milan group Mondadori filmtv.it which soon became the most popular of the magazine with a myriad of collaborators. In the following period the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico appears as a column in various newspapers and magazines (the Netwerk group, La Voce, is mentioned in La Stampa and many other newspapers) and officially appears as a cultural movement that gives full freedom to all to join simply using the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico (respecting however the topics of interest of the movement) coming to create totally independent sections (but always within legally registered bodies or associations), with their own statutes and directives but with only provided that the official founder (helped at the beginning by the first members) Davide Lingua is recognized as Permanent Director for life (in fact director and not president because he wants to underline the journalistic origin of the project).

From its birth until today the Dizionario del Turismo Cinematografico is a worldwide journalistic column, television broadcasting, has sections in many associations, institutions that collaborate with municipal administrations, has dealt with the official celebrations of film shooting anniversaries (for example Salasco of the film Bitter Rice), appears in the credits of many films for the collaboration given, organizes communication courses, cultural and sporting events, etc. ...

Volunteer tourism
Volunteer tourism (or voluntourism) is growing as a largely Western phenomenon, with volunteers traveling to aid those less fortunate than themselves in order to counter global inequalities. Wearing (2001) defines volunteer tourism as applying "to those tourists who, for various reasons, volunteer in an organised way to undertake holidays that might involve aiding or alleviating the material poverty of some groups in society".[73] VSO was founded in the UK in 1958 and the US Peace Corps was subsequently founded in 1960. These were the first large scale voluntary sending organisations, initially arising to modernise less economically developed countries, which it was hoped would curb the influence of communism.[74]

This form of tourism is largely praised for its more sustainable approach to travel, with tourists attempting to assimilate into local cultures, and avoiding the criticisms of consumptive and exploitative mass tourism.[75] However, increasingly voluntourism is being criticised by scholars who suggest it may have negative effects as it begins to undermine local labour, and force unwilling host communities to adopt Western initiatives,[76] while host communities without a strong heritage fail to retain volunteers who become dissatisfied with experiences and volunteer shortages persist.[77] Increasingly organisations such as VSO have been concerned with community-centric volunteer programmes where power to control the future of the community is in the hands of local people.[78]

Pro-poor tourism, which seeks to help the poorest people in developing countries, has been receiving increasing attention by those involved in development; the issue has been addressed through small-scale projects in local communities and through attempts by Ministries of Tourism to attract large numbers of tourists. Research by the Overseas Development Institute suggests that neither is the best way to encourage tourists' money to reach the poorest as only 25% or less (far less in some cases) ever reaches the poor; successful examples of money reaching the poor include mountain-climbing in Tanzania and cultural tourism in Luang Prabang, Laos.[79] There is also the possibility of pro-poor tourism principles being adopted in centre sites of regeneration in the developed world.[80]

Recession tourism
Recession tourism is a travel trend which evolved by way of the world economic crisis. Recession tourism is defined by low-cost and high-value experiences taking place of once-popular generic retreats. Various recession tourism hotspots have seen business boom during the recession thanks to comparatively low costs of living and a slow world job market suggesting travelers are elongating trips where their money travels further. This concept is not widely used in tourism research. It is related to the short-lived phenomenon that is more widely known as staycation.

Medical tourism
Main article: Medical tourism
When there is a significant price difference between countries for a given medical procedure, particularly in Southeast Asia, India, Eastern Europe, Cuba[81] and Canada[82] where there are different regulatory regimes, in relation to particular medical procedures (e.g. dentistry), traveling to take advantage of the price or regulatory differences is often referred to as "medical tourism".

Educational tourism is developed because of the growing popularity of teaching and learning of knowledge and the enhancing of technical competency outside of the classroom environment. In educational tourism, the main focus of the tour or leisure activity includes visiting another country to learn about the culture, study tours, or to work and apply skills learned inside the classroom in a different environment, such as in the International Practicum Training Program.

Event tourism
This type of tourism is focused on tourists coming into a region to either participate in an event or to see an organized event put on by the city/region.[56] This type of tourism can also fall under sustainable tourism as well and companies that create a sustainable event to attend open up a chance to not only the consumer but their workers to learn and develop from the experience. Creating a sustainable atmosphere it creates a chance to inform and encourage sustainable practices. An example of event tourism would be the music festival South by Southwest that is hosted in Austin, Texas annually. This is a perfect example because every year people from all over the world flock to this one city for one week to sit in on technology talks and see a whole city of bands perform. These people are being drawn here to experience something that they are not able to experience in their hometown which is exactly what event tourism is about.

Creative tourism has existed as a form of cultural tourism, since the early beginnings of tourism itself. Its European roots date back to the time of the Grand Tour, which saw the sons of aristocratic families traveling for the purpose of mostly interactive, educational experiences. More recently, creative tourism has been given its own name by Crispin Raymond and Greg Richards,[83] who as members of the Association for Tourism and Leisure Education (ATLAS), have directed a number of projects for the European Commission, including cultural and crafts tourism, known as sustainable tourism. They have defined "creative tourism" as tourism related to the active participation of travelers in the culture of the host community, through interactive workshops and informal learning experiences.[83]

Meanwhile, the concept of creative tourism has been picked up by high-profile organizations such as UNESCO, who through the Creative Cities Network, have endorsed creative tourism as an engaged, authentic experience that promotes an active understanding of the specific cultural features of a place.[citation needed]

More recently, creative tourism has gained popularity as a form of cultural tourism, drawing on active participation by travelers in the culture of the host communities they visit. Several countries offer examples of this type of tourism development, including the United Kingdom, Austria, France, the Bahamas, Jamaica, Spain, Italy, New Zealand and South Korea.[84][citation needed]

The growing interest of tourists[85] in this new way to discover a culture regards particularly the operators and branding managers, attentive to the possibility of attracting a quality tourism, highlighting the intangible heritage (craft workshops, cooking classes, etc.) and optimizing the use of existing infrastructure (for example, through the rent of halls and auditorium).

Experiential tourism
Experiential travel (or "immersion travel") is one of the major market trends in the modern tourism industry. It is an approach to travelling which focuses on experiencing a country, city or particular place by connecting to its history, people, food and culture.[86]

The term "experiential travel" has been mentioned in publications since 1985,[87] but it wasn't discovered as a meaningful market trend until much later.

One emerging area of special interest has been identified by Lennon and Foley (2000)[88][89] as "dark" tourism. This type of tourism involves visits to "dark" sites, such as battlegrounds, scenes of horrific crimes or acts of genocide, for example concentration camps. Its origins are rooted in fairgrounds and medieval fairs.[90]

Philip Stone argues that dark tourism is a way of imagining one's own death through the real death of others.[91] Erik H Cohen introduces the term "populo sites" to evidence the educational character of dark tourism. Popular sites transmit the story of victimized people to visitors. Based on a study at Yad Vashem, the Shoah (Holocaust) memorial museum in Jerusalem, a new term—in populo—is proposed to describe dark tourism sites at a spiritual and population center of the people to whom a tragedy befell. Learning about the Shoah in Jerusalem offers an encounter with the subject which is different from visits to sites in Europe, but equally authentic. It is argued that a dichotomy between "authentic" sites at the location of a tragedy and "created" sites elsewhere is insufficient. Participants' evaluations of seminars for European teachers at Yad Vashem indicate that the location is an important aspect of a meaningful encounter with the subject. Implications for other cases of dark tourism at in populo locations are discussed.[92] In this vein, Peter Tarlow defines dark tourism as the tendency to visit the scenes of tragedies or historically noteworthy deaths, which continue to impact our lives. This issue cannot be understood without the figure of trauma.[93]

Social tourism
Social tourism is making tourism available to poor people who otherwise could not afford to travel for their education or recreation. It includes youth hostels and low-priced holiday accommodation run by church and voluntary organisations, trade unions, or in Communist times publicly owned enterprises. In May 1959, at the second Congress of Social Tourism in Austria, Walter Hunziker proposed the following definition: "Social tourism is a type of tourism practiced by low-income groups, and which is rendered possible and facilitated by entirely separate and therefore easily recognizable services".[94]

Also known as "Tourism of Doom," or "Last Chance Tourism" this emerging trend involves traveling to places that are environmentally or otherwise threatened (such as the ice caps of Mount Kilimanjaro, the melting glaciers of Patagonia, or the coral of the Great Barrier Reef) before it is too late. Identified by travel trade magazine Travel Age West[95] editor-in-chief Kenneth Shapiro in 2007 and later explored in The New York Times,[96] this type of tourism is believed to be on the rise. Some see the trend as related to sustainable tourism or ecotourism due to the fact that a number of these tourist destinations are considered threatened by environmental factors such as global warming, overpopulation or climate change. Others worry that travel to many of these threatened locations increases an individual's carbon footprint and only hastens problems threatened locations are already facing.[97][98][99][100][101]

Religious tourism, in particular pilgrimage, can serve to strengthen faith and to demonstrate devotion - both of which are central tenets of many major religions.[102][need quotation to verify] Religious tourists may seek destinations whose image encourages them to believe that they can strengthen the religious elements of their self-identity in a positive manner. Given this, the perceived image of a destination may be positively influenced by whether it conforms to the requirements of their religious self-identity or not.[103]

DNA tourism
DNA tourism, also called "ancestry tourism" or "heritage travel", is tourism based on DNA testing. DNA tourists visit their remote relatives or places where their ancestors came from, or where their relatives reside, based on the results of DNA tests. According to the media, DNA testing has become a growing trend in 2019.[104][105]

Tourism fatigue
Excessive hordes of visitors - or of the wrong sort of visitors - can provoke backlashes from otherwise friendly hosts in popular destinations.[106]

Negative environmental consequences
Negative environmental consequences related to tourism activities, such as greenhouse gas emissions from air travel, and litter at popular locations, can be significant.

Illegal activities
Tourism is sometimes associated with export or theft of contraband such as endangered species or certain cultural artifacts, and illegal sex trade activities.

Growth
The World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) forecasts that international tourism will continue growing at the average annual rate of 4%.[107] With the advent of e-commerce, tourism products have become one of the most traded items on the internet.[citation needed] Tourism products and services have been made available through intermediaries, although tourism providers (hotels, airlines, etc.), including small-scale operators, can sell their services directly.[108][109] This has put pressure on intermediaries from both on-line and traditional shops.

It has been suggested there is a strong correlation between tourism expenditure per capita and the degree to which countries play in the global context.[110] Not only as a result of the important economic contribution of the tourism industry, but also as an indicator of the degree of confidence with which global citizens leverage the resources of the globe for the benefit of their local economies. This is why any projections of growth in tourism may serve as an indication of the relative influence that each country will exercise in the future.

Space tourism
Main article: Space tourism
There has been a limited amount of orbital space tourism, with only the Russian Space Agency providing transport to date. A 2010 report into space tourism anticipated that it could become a billion-dollar market by 2030.[111]

Since the late 1980s, sports tourism has become increasingly popular. Events such as rugby, Olympics, Commonwealth Games, and FIFA World Cups have enabled specialist travel companies to gain official ticket allocation and then sell them in packages that include flights, hotels and excursions.

As a result of the late-2000s recession, international arrivals suffered a strong slowdown beginning in June 2008. Growth from 2007 to 2008 was only 3.7% during the first eight months of 2008. This slowdown on international tourism demand was also reflected in the air transport industry, with a negative growth in September 2008 and a 3.3% growth in passenger traffic through September. The hotel industry also reported a slowdown, with room occupancy declining. In 2009 worldwide tourism arrivals decreased by 3.8%.[112] By the first quarter of 2009, real travel demand in the United States had fallen 6% over six quarters. While this is considerably milder than what occurred after the 9/11 attacks, the decline was at twice the rate as real GDP has fallen.[113][114]

However, evidence suggests that tourism as a global phenomenon shows no signs of substantially abating in the long term. It has been suggested that travel is necessary in order to maintain relationships, as social life is increasingly networked and conducted at a distance.[115] For many people vacations and travel are increasingly being viewed as a necessity rather than a luxury, and this is reflected in tourist numbers recovering some 6.6% globally over 2009, with growth up to 8% in emerging economies.[112]

Food

Food is any substance[1] consumed to provide nutritional support for an organism. Food is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.

Historically, humans secured food through two methods: hunting and gathering and agriculture, which gave modern humans a mainly omnivorous diet. Worldwide, humanity has created numerous cuisines and culinary arts, including a wide array of ingredients, herbs, spices, techniques, and dishes.

Today, the majority of the food energy required by the ever increasing population of the world is supplied by the food industry. Food safety and food security are monitored by agencies like the International Association for Food Protection, World Resources Institute, World Food Programme, Food and Agriculture Organization, and International Food Information Council. They address issues such as sustainability, biological diversity, climate change, nutritional economics, population growth, water supply, and access to food.

The right to food is a human right derived from the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR), recognizing the "right to an adequate standard of living, including adequate food", as well as the "fundamental right to be free from hunger".

Food sources
Most food has its origin in plants. Some food is obtained directly from plants; but even animals that are used as food sources are raised by feeding them food derived from plants. Cereal grain is a staple food that provides more food energy worldwide than any other type of crop.[2] Corn (maize), wheat, and rice – in all of their varieties – account for 87% of all grain production worldwide.[3][4][5] Most of the grain that is produced worldwide is fed to livestock.

Some foods not from animal or plant sources include various edible fungi, especially mushrooms. Fungi and ambient bacteria are used in the preparation of fermented and pickled foods like leavened bread, alcoholic drinks, cheese, pickles, kombucha, and yogurt. Another example is blue-green algae such as Spirulina.[6] Inorganic substances such as salt, baking soda and cream of tartar are used to preserve or chemically alter an ingredient.

Plants
See also: Herb and spice
Many plants and plant parts are eaten as food and around 2,000 plant species are cultivated for food. Many of these plant species have several distinct cultivars.[7]

Seeds of plants are a good source of food for animals, including humans, because they contain the nutrients necessary for the plant's initial growth, including many healthful fats, such as omega fats. In fact, the majority of food consumed by human beings are seed-based foods. Edible seeds include cereals (corn, wheat, rice, et cetera), legumes (beans, peas, lentils, et cetera), and nuts. Oilseeds are often pressed to produce rich oils - sunflower, flaxseed, rapeseed (including canola oil), sesame, et cetera.[8]

Seeds are typically high in unsaturated fats and, in moderation, are considered a health food. However, not all seeds are edible. Large seeds, such as those from a lemon, pose a choking hazard, while seeds from cherries and apples contain cyanide which could be poisonous only if consumed in large volumes.[9]

Fruits are the ripened ovaries of plants, including the seeds within. Many plants and animals have coevolved such that the fruits of the former are an attractive food source to the latter, because animals that eat the fruits may excrete the seeds some distance away. Fruits, therefore, make up a significant part of the diets of most cultures. Some botanical fruits, such as tomatoes, pumpkins, and eggplants, are eaten as vegetables.[10] (For more information, see list of fruits.)

Vegetables are a second type of plant matter that is commonly eaten as food. These include root vegetables (potatoes and carrots), bulbs (onion family), leaf vegetables (spinach and lettuce), stem vegetables (bamboo shoots and asparagus), and inflorescence vegetables (globe artichokes and broccoli and other vegetables such as cabbage or cauliflower).[11]

Animals are used as food either directly or indirectly by the products they produce. Meat is an example of a direct product taken from an animal, which comes from muscle systems or from organs (offal).

Food products produced by animals include milk produced by mammary glands, which in many cultures is drunk or processed into dairy products (cheese, butter, etc.). In addition, birds and other animals lay eggs, which are often eaten, and bees produce honey, a reduced nectar from flowers, which is a popular sweetener in many cultures. Some cultures consume blood, sometimes in the form of blood sausage, as a thickener for sauces, or in a cured, salted form for times of food scarcity, and others use blood in stews such as jugged hare.[12]

Some cultures and people do not consume meat or animal food products for cultural, dietary, health, ethical, or ideological reasons. Vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Vegans do not consume any foods that are or contain ingredients from an animal source.

Adulteration is a legal term meaning that a food product fails to meet the legal standards. One form of adulteration is an addition of another substance to a food item in order to increase the quantity of the food item in raw form or prepared form, which may result in the loss of actual quality of food item. These substances may be either available food items or non-food items. Among meat and meat products some of the items used to adulterate are water or ice, carcasses, or carcasses of animals other than the animal meant to be consumed.[13]

Camping food includes ingredients used to prepare food suitable for backcountry camping and backpacking. The foods differ substantially from the ingredients found in a typical home kitchen. The primary differences relate to campers' and backpackers' special needs for foods that have appropriate cooking time, perishability, weight, and nutritional content.

To address these needs, camping food is often made up of either freeze-dried, precooked or dehydrated ingredients. Many campers use a combination of these foods.

Freeze-drying requires the use of heavy machinery and is not something that most campers are able to do on their own. Freeze-dried ingredients are often considered superior to dehydrated ingredients however, because they rehydrate at camp faster and retain more flavor than their dehydrated counterparts. Freeze-dried ingredients take so little time to rehydrate that they can often be eaten without cooking them first and have a texture similar to a crunchy chip.

Dehydration can reduce the weight of the food by sixty to ninety percent by removing water through evaporation. Some foods dehydrate well, such as onions, peppers, and tomatoes.[14][15] Dehydration often produces a more compact, albeit slightly heavier, end result than freeze-drying.

Surplus precooked military Meals, Meals, Ready-to-Eat (MREs) are sometimes used by campers. These meals contain precooked foods in retort pouches. A retort pouch is a plastic and metal foil laminate pouch that is used as an alternative to traditional industrial canning methods.

Diet food (or "dietetic food") refers to any food or beverage whose recipe is altered to reduce fat, carbohydrates, abhor/adhore sugar in order to make it part of a weight loss program or diet. Such foods are usually intended to assist in weight loss or a change in body type, although bodybuilding supplements are designed to aid in gaining weight or muscle.

The process of making a diet version of a food usually requires finding an acceptable low-food-energy substitute for some high-food-energy ingredient.[16] This can be as simple as replacing some or all of the food's sugar with a sugar substitute as is common with diet soft drinks such as Coca-Cola (for example Diet Coke). In some snacks, the food may be baked instead of fried thus reducing the food energy. In other cases, low-fat ingredients may be used as replacements.

In whole grain foods, the higher fiber content effectively displaces some of the starch component of the flour. Since certain fibers have no food energy, this results in a modest energy reduction. Another technique relies on the intentional addition of other reduced-food-energy ingredients, such as resistant starch or dietary fiber, to replace part of the flour and achieve a more significant energy reduction.

Finger food is food meant to be eaten directly using the hands, in contrast to food eaten with a knife and fork, spoon, chopsticks, or other utensils.[17] In some cultures, food is almost always eaten with the hands; for example, Ethiopian cuisine is eaten by rolling various dishes up in injera bread.[18] Foods considered street foods are frequently, though not exclusively, finger foods.

In the western world, finger foods are often either appetizers (hors d'œuvres) or entree/main course items. Examples of these are miniature meat pies, sausage rolls, sausages on sticks, cheese and olives on sticks, chicken drumsticks or wings, spring rolls, miniature quiches, samosas, sandwiches, Merenda or other such based foods, such as pitas or items in buns, bhajjis, potato wedges, vol au vents, several other such small items and risotto balls (arancini). Other well-known foods that are generally eaten with the hands include hamburgers, pizza, Chips, hot dogs, fruit and bread.

In East Asia, foods like pancakes or flatbreads (bing 饼) and street foods such as chuan (串, also pronounced chuan) are often eaten with the hands.

Fresh food is food which has not been preserved and has not spoiled yet. For vegetables and fruits, this means that they have been recently harvested and treated properly postharvest; for meat, it has recently been slaughtered and butchered; for fish, it has been recently caught or harvested and kept cold.

Dairy products are fresh and will spoil quickly. Thus, fresh cheese is cheese which has not been dried or salted for aging. Soured cream may be considered "fresh" (crème fraîche).

Fresh food has not been dried, smoked, salted, frozen, canned, pickled, or otherwise preserved.[19]

Freezing food preserves it from the time it is prepared to the time it is eaten. Since early times, farmers, fishermen, and trappers have preserved grains and produce in unheated buildings during the winter season.[20] Freezing food slows down decomposition by turning residual moisture into ice, inhibiting the growth of most bacterial species. In the food commodity industry, there are two processes: mechanical and cryogenic (or flash freezing). The kinetics of the freezing is important to preserve the food quality and texture. Quicker freezing generates smaller ice crystals and maintains cellular structure. Cryogenic freezing is the quickest freezing technology available utilizing the extremely low temperature of liquid nitrogen −196 °C (−320 °F).[21]

Preserving food in domestic kitchens during modern times is achieved using household freezers. Accepted advice to householders was to freeze food on the day of purchase. An initiative by a supermarket group in 2012 (backed by the UK's Waste & Resources Action Programme) promotes the freezing of food "as soon as possible up to the product's 'use by' date". The Food Standards Agency was reported as supporting the change, providing the food had been stored correctly up to that time.[22]

Functional food
Main article: Functional food
A functional food is a food given an additional function (often one related to health-promotion or disease prevention) by adding new ingredients or more of existing ingredients.[23] The term may also apply to traits purposely bred into existing edible plants, such as purple or gold potatoes having enriched anthocyanin or carotenoid contents, respectively.[24] Functional foods may be "designed to have physiological benefits and/or reduce the risk of chronic disease beyond basic nutritional functions, and may be similar in appearance to conventional food and consumed as part of a regular diet".[25]

The term was first used in Japan in the 1980s where there is a government approval process for functional foods called Foods for Specified Health Use (FOSHU).[26]

Health food
Main article: Health food
Health food is food marketed to provide human health effects beyond a normal healthy diet required for human nutrition. Foods marketed as health foods may be part of one or more categories, such as natural foods, organic foods, whole foods, vegetarian foods or dietary supplements. These products may be sold in health food stores or in the health food or organic sections of grocery stores.

A healthy diet is a diet that helps to maintain or improve overall health. A healthy diet provides the body with essential nutrition: fluid, macronutrients, micronutrients, and adequate calories.[27][28]

For people who are healthy, a healthy diet is not complicated and contains mostly fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, and includes little to no processed food and sweetened beverages. The requirements for a healthy diet can be met from a variety of plant-based and animal-based foods, although a non-animal source of vitamin B12 is needed for those following a vegan diet.[29] Various nutrition guides are published by medical and governmental institutions to educate individuals on what they should be eating to be healthy. Nutrition facts labels are also mandatory in some countries to allow consumers to choose between foods based on the components relevant to health.[30]

A healthy lifestyle includes getting exercise every day along with eating a healthy diet. A healthy lifestyle may lower disease risks, such as obesity, heart disease, type 2 diabetes, hypertension and cancer.[27][31]

There are specialized healthy diets, called medical nutrition therapy, for people with various diseases or conditions. There are also prescientific ideas about such specialized diets, as in dietary therapy in traditional Chinese medicine.

The World Health Organization (WHO) makes the following 5 recommendations with respect to both populations and individuals:[32]

Maintain a healthy weight by eating roughly the same number of calories that your body is using.
Limit intake of fats. Not more than 30% of the total calories should come from fats. Prefer unsaturated fats to saturated fats. Avoid trans fats.
Eat at least 400 grams of fruits and vegetables per day (potatoes, sweet potatoes, cassava and other starchy roots do not count). A healthy diet also contains legumes (e.g. lentils, beans), whole grains and nuts.
Limit the intake of simple sugars to less than 10% of calorie (below 5% of calories or 25 grams may be even better)[33]
Limit salt / sodium from all sources and ensure that salt is iodized. Less than 5 grams of salt per day can reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease.[34]

Kosher foods are those that conform to the Jewish dietary regulations of kashrut (dietary law), primarily derived from Leviticus and Deuteronomy. Food that may be consumed according to halakha (law) is termed kosher (/ˈkoʊʃər/) in English, from the Ashkenazi pronunciation of the Hebrew term kashér (כָּשֵׁר), meaning "fit" (in this context, fit for consumption). Food that is not in accordance with law is called treif (/treɪf/; Yiddish: טרײף‎, derived from Hebrew: טְרֵפָה‎ trāfáh) meaning "torn."

Live food is living food for carnivorous or omnivorous animals kept in captivity; in other words, small animals such as insects or mice fed to larger carnivorous or omnivorous species kept in either in a zoo or as pet.

Live food is commonly used as feed for a variety of species of exotic pets and zoo animals, ranging from alligators to various snakes, frogs and lizards, but also including other, non-reptile, non-amphibian carnivores and omnivores (for instance, skunks, which are omnivorous mammals, can be technically be fed a limited amount of live food, though this is not known to be a common practice). Common live food ranges from crickets (used as an inexpensive form of feed for carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles such as bearded dragons and commonly available in pet stores for this reason), waxworms, mealworms and to a lesser extent cockroaches and locusts, to small birds and mammals such as mice or chickens.

Medical foods are foods that are specially formulated and intended for the dietary management of a disease that has distinctive nutritional needs that cannot be met by normal diet alone. In the United States they were defined in the Food and Drug Administration's 1988 Orphan Drug Act Amendments[35] and are subject to the general food and safety labeling requirements of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act. In Europe the European Food Safety Authority established definitions for "foods for special medical purposes" (FSMPs) in 2015.[36]

Medical foods, called "food for special medical purposes" in Europe,[37] are distinct from the broader category of foods for special dietary use, from traditional foods that bear a health claim, and from dietary supplements. In order to be considered a medical food the product must, at a minimum:[38][39]

be a food for oral ingestion or tube feeding (nasogastric tube)
be labeled for the dietary management of a specific medical disorder, disease or condition for which there are distinctive nutritional requirements, and
be intended to be used under medical supervision.
Medical foods can be classified into the following categories:

Nutritionally complete formulas
Nutritionally incomplete formulas
Formulas for metabolic disorders
Oral rehydration products

Natural foods and "all natural foods" are widely used terms in food labeling and marketing with a variety of definitions, most of which are vague. The term is often assumed to imply foods that are not processed and whose ingredients are all natural products (in the chemist's sense of that term), thus conveying an appeal to nature. But the lack of standards in most jurisdictions means that the term assures nothing. In some countries, the term "natural" is defined and enforced. In others, such as the United States, it is not enforced.

“Natural foods” are often assumed to be foods that are not processed, or do not contain any food additives, or do not contain particular additives such as hormones, antibiotics, sweeteners, food colors, or flavorings that were not originally in the food.[40] In fact, many people (63%) when surveyed showed a preference for products labeled "natural" compared to the unmarked counterparts, based on the common belief (86% of polled consumers) that the term "natural" indicated that the food does not contain any artificial ingredients.[41] The terms are variously used and misused on labels and in advertisements.[42]

The international Food and Agriculture Organization’s Codex Alimentarius does not recognize the term “natural” but does have a standard for organic foods.[43]

Negative-calorie food
Main article: Negative-calorie food
A negative-calorie food is food that supposedly requires more food energy to be digested than the food provides. Its thermic effect or specific dynamic action – the caloric "cost" of digesting the food – would be greater than its food energy content. Despite its recurring popularity in dieting guides, there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that any food is calorically negative. While some chilled beverages are calorically negative, the effect is minimal[44] and drinking large amounts of water can be dangerous.

Organic food is food produced by methods that comply with the standards of organic farming. Standards vary worldwide, but organic farming in general features practices that strive to cycle resources, promote ecological balance, and conserve biodiversity. Organizations regulating organic products may restrict the use of certain pesticides and fertilizers in farming. In general, organic foods are also usually not processed using irradiation, industrial solvents or synthetic food additives.[45]

Currently, the European Union, the United States, Canada, Mexico, Japan, and many other countries require producers to obtain special certification in order to market food as organic within their borders. In the context of these regulations, organic food is produced in a way that complies with organic standards set by regional organizations, national governments and international organizations. Although the produce of kitchen gardens may be organic, selling food with an organic label is regulated by governmental food safety authorities, such as the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) or European Commission (EC).[46]

Fertilizing and the use of pesticides in conventional farming has caused, and is causing, enormous damage worldwide to local ecosystems, biodiversity, groundwater and drinking water supplies, and sometimes farmer health and fertility. These environmental, economic and health issues are intended to be minimized or avoided in organic farming. From a consumers perspective, there is not sufficient evidence in scientific and medical literature to support claims that organic food is safer or healthier to eat than conventionally grown food. While there may be some differences in the nutrient and antinutrient contents of organically- and conventionally-produced food, the variable nature of food production and handling makes it difficult to generalize results.[47][48][49][50][51] Claims that organic food tastes better are generally not supported by tests.[48][52]

Peasant foods are dishes specific to a particular culture, made from accessible and inexpensive ingredients, and usually prepared and seasoned to make them more palatable. They often form a significant part of the diets of people who live in poverty, or have a lower income compared to the average for their society or country.

Peasant foods have been described as being the diet of peasants, that is, tenant or poorer farmers and their farm workers,[53] and by extension, of other cash-poor people. They may use ingredients, such as offal and less-tender cuts of meat, which are not as marketable as a cash crop. Characteristic recipes often consist of hearty one-dish meals, in which chunks of meat and various vegetables are eaten in a savory broth, with bread or other staple food. Sausages are also amenable to varied readily available ingredients, and they themselves tend to contain offal and grains.

Peasant foods often involve skilled preparation by knowledgeable cooks using inventiveness and skills passed down from earlier generations. Such dishes are often prized as ethnic foods by other cultures and by descendants of the native culture who still desire these traditional dishes.[citation needed]

Prison food is the term for meals served to prisoners while incarcerated in correctional institutions. While some prisons prepare their own food, many use staff from on-site catering companies. Many prisons today support the requirements of specific religions, as well as vegetarianism.[54] It is said that prison food of many developed countries is adequate to maintain health and dieting.[55][unreliable source?]

"Seasonal" here refers to the times of year when the harvest or the flavour of a given type food is at its peak. This is usually the time when the item is harvested, with some exceptions; an example being sweet potatoes which are best eaten quite a while after harvest. It also appeals to people who prefer a low carbon diet that reduces the greenhouse gas emissions resulting from food consumption (Food miles).

Shelf-stable food (sometimes ambient food) is food of a type that can be safely stored at room temperature in a sealed container. This includes foods that would normally be stored refrigerated but which have been processed so that they can be safely stored at room or ambient temperature for a usefully long shelf life.

Various food preservation and packaging techniques are used to extend a food's shelf life. Decreasing the amount of available water in a product, increasing its acidity, or irradiating[56] or otherwise sterilizing the food and then sealing it in an air-tight container are all ways of depriving bacteria of suitable conditions in which to thrive. All of these approaches can all extend a food's shelf life without unacceptably changing its taste or texture.

For some foods alternative ingredients can be used. Common oils and fats become rancid relatively quickly if not refrigerated; replacing them with hydrogenated oils delays the onset of rancidity, increasing shelf life. This is a common approach in industrial food production, but recent concerns about health hazards associated with trans fats have led to their strict control in several jurisdictions.[57] Even where trans fats are not prohibited, in many places there are new labeling laws (or rules), which require information to be printed on packages, or to be published elsewhere, about the amount of trans fat contained in certain products.

Space food is a type of food product created and processed for consumption by astronauts in outer space. The food has specific requirements of providing balanced nutrition for individuals working in space, while being easy and safe to store, prepare and consume in the machinery-filled weightless environments of manned spacecraft.

In recent years, space food has been used by various nations engaging on space programs as a way to share and show off their cultural identity and facilitate intercultural communication. Although astronauts consume a wide variety of foods and beverages in space, the initial idea from The Man in Space Committee of the Space Science Board in 1963 was to supply astronauts with a formula diet that would supply all the needed vitamins and nutrients.[58]

Traditional foods are foods and dishes that are passed through generations[59] or which have been consumed many generations.[60] Traditional foods and dishes are traditional in nature, and may have a historic precedent in a national dish, regional cuisine[59] or local cuisine. Traditional foods and beverages may be produced as homemade, by restaurants and small manufacturers, and by large food processing plant facilities.[61]

Some traditional foods have geographical indications and traditional specialities in the European Union designations per European Union schemes of geographical indications and traditional specialties: Protected designation of origin (PDO), Protected geographical indication (PGI) and Traditional specialities guaranteed (TSG). These standards serve to promote and protect names of quality agricultural products and foodstuffs.[62]

This article also includes information about traditional beverages.

Whole foods are plant foods that are unprocessed and unrefined, or processed and refined as little as possible, before being consumed.[63] Examples of whole foods include whole grains, tubers, legumes, fruits, vegetables.[64]

There is some confusion over the usage of the term surrounding the inclusion of certain foods, in particular animal foods. The modern usage of the term whole foods diet is now widely synonymous with "whole foods plant-based diet" with animal products, oil and salt no longer constituting whole foods.[65]

The earliest use of the term in the post-industrial age appears to be in 1946 in The Farmer, a quarterly magazine published and edited from his farm by F. Newman Turner, a writer and pioneering organic farmer. The magazine sponsored the establishment of the Producer Consumer Whole Food Society Ltd, with Newman Turner as president and Derek Randal as vice-president.[66] Whole food was defined as "mature produce of field, orchard, or garden without subtraction, addition, or alteration grown from seed without chemical dressing, in fertile soil manured solely with animal and vegetable wastes, and composts therefrom, and ground, raw rock and without chemical manures, sprays, or insecticides," having intent to connect suppliers and the growing public demand for such food.[66] Such diets are rich in whole and unrefined foods, like whole grains, dark green and yellow/orange-fleshed vegetables and fruits, legumes, nuts and seeds.[63]

Most food has always been obtained through agriculture. With increasing concern over both the methods and products of modern industrial agriculture, there has been a growing trend toward sustainable agricultural practices. This approach, partly fueled by consumer demand, encourages biodiversity, local self-reliance and organic farming methods.[67] Major influences on food production include international organizations (e.g. the World Trade Organization and Common Agricultural Policy), national government policy (or law), and war.[68]

Several organisations have begun calling for a new kind of agriculture in which agroecosystems provide food but also support vital ecosystem services so that soil fertility and biodiversity are maintained rather than compromised. According to the International Water Management Institute and UNEP, well-managed agroecosystems not only provide food, fiber and animal products, they also provide services such as flood mitigation, groundwater recharge, erosion control and habitats for plants, birds, fish and other animals.[69]

Animals, specifically humans, have five different types of tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, and umami. As animals have evolved, the tastes that provide the most energy (sugar and fats) are the most pleasant to eat while others, such as bitter, are not enjoyable.[70] Water, while important for survival, has no taste.[71] Fats, on the other hand, especially saturated fats, are thicker and rich and are thus considered more enjoyable to eat.

Generally regarded as the most pleasant taste, sweetness is almost always caused by a type of simple sugar such as glucose or fructose, or disaccharides such as sucrose, a molecule combining glucose and fructose.[72] Complex carbohydrates are long chains and thus do not have the sweet taste. Artificial sweeteners such as sucralose are used to mimic the sugar molecule, creating the sensation of sweet, without the calories. Other types of sugar include raw sugar, which is known for its amber color, as it is unprocessed. As sugar is vital for energy and survival, the taste of sugar is pleasant.

The stevia plant contains a compound known as steviol which, when extracted, has 300 times the sweetness of sugar while having minimal impact on blood sugar.[73]

Sour
Sourness is caused by the taste of acids, such as vinegar in alcoholic beverages. Sour foods include citrus, specifically lemons, limes, and to a lesser degree oranges. Sour is evolutionarily significant as it is a sign for a food that may have gone rancid due to bacteria.[74] Many foods, however, are slightly acidic, and help stimulate the taste buds and enhance flavor.

Saltiness is the taste of alkali metal ions such as sodium and potassium. It is found in almost every food in low to moderate proportions to enhance flavor, although to eat pure salt is regarded as highly unpleasant. There are many different types of salt, with each having a different degree of saltiness, including sea salt, fleur de sel, kosher salt, mined salt, and grey salt. Other than enhancing flavor, its significance is that the body needs and maintains a delicate electrolyte balance, which is the kidney's function. Salt may be iodized, meaning iodine has been added to it, a necessary nutrient that promotes thyroid function. Some canned foods, notably soups or packaged broths, tend to be high in salt as a means of preserving the food longer. Historically salt has long been used as a meat preservative as salt promotes water excretion. Similarly, dried foods also promote food safety.[75]

Bitter
Bitterness is a sensation often considered unpleasant characterized by having a sharp, pungent taste. Unsweetened dark chocolate, caffeine, lemon rind, and some types of fruit are known to be bitter.

Umami
Umami, the Japanese word for delicious, is the least known in Western popular culture but has a long tradition in Asian cuisine. Umami is the taste of glutamates, especially monosodium glutamate (MSG).[72] It is characterized as savory, meaty, and rich in flavor.[76] Salmon and mushrooms are foods high in umami.[77]

Many scholars claim that the rhetorical function of food is to represent the culture of a country, and that it can be used as a form of communication. According to Goode, Curtis and Theophano, food "is the last aspect of an ethnic culture to be lost".[78]

Many cultures have a recognizable cuisine, a specific set of cooking traditions using various spices or a combination of flavors unique to that culture, which evolves over time. Other differences include preferences (hot or cold, spicy, etc.) and practices, the study of which is known as gastronomy. Many cultures have diversified their foods by means of preparation, cooking methods, and manufacturing. This also includes a complex food trade which helps the cultures to economically survive by way of food, not just by consumption.

Some popular types of ethnic foods include Italian, French, Japanese, Chinese, American, Cajun, Thai, African, Indian and Nepalese. Various cultures throughout the world study the dietary analysis of food habits. While evolutionarily speaking, as opposed to culturally, humans are omnivores, religion and social constructs such as morality, activism, or environmentalism will often affect which foods they will consume. Food is eaten and typically enjoyed through the sense of taste, the perception of flavor from eating and drinking. Certain tastes are more enjoyable than others, for evolutionary purposes.

Aesthetically pleasing and eye-appealing food presentations can encourage people to consume foods. A common saying is that people "eat with their eyes". Food presented in a clean and appetizing way will encourage a good flavor, even if unsatisfactory.[79][80]

Contrast in texture
Texture plays a crucial role in the enjoyment of eating foods. Contrasts in textures, such as something crunchy in an otherwise smooth dish, may increase the appeal of eating it. Common examples include adding granola to yogurt, adding croutons to a salad or soup, and toasting bread to enhance its crunchiness for a smooth topping, such as jam or butter.[81]

Contrast in taste
Another universal phenomenon regarding food is the appeal of contrast in taste and presentation. For example, such opposite flavors as sweetness and saltiness tend to go well together, as in kettle corn and nuts.

Food preparation
Main article: Outline of food preparation
While many foods can be eaten raw, many also undergo some form of preparation for reasons of safety, palatability, texture, or flavor. At the simplest level this may involve washing, cutting, trimming, or adding other foods or ingredients, such as spices. It may also involve mixing, heating or cooling, pressure cooking, fermentation, or combination with other food. In a home, most food preparation takes place in a kitchen. Some preparation is done to enhance the taste or aesthetic appeal; other preparation may help to preserve the food; others may be involved in cultural identity. A meal is made up of food which is prepared to be eaten at a specific time and place.[82]

Animal preparation
The preparation of animal-based food usually involves slaughter, evisceration, hanging, portioning, and rendering. In developed countries, this is usually done outside the home in slaughterhouses, which are used to process animals en masse for meat production. Many countries regulate their slaughterhouses by law. For example, the United States has established the Humane Slaughter Act of 1958, which requires that an animal be stunned before killing. This act, like those in many countries, exempts slaughter in accordance to religious law, such as kosher, shechita, and dhabīḥah halal. Strict interpretations of kashrut require the animal to be fully aware when its carotid artery is cut.[83]

On the local level, a butcher may commonly break down larger animal meat into smaller manageable cuts, and pre-wrap them for commercial sale or wrap them to order in butcher paper. In addition, fish and seafood may be fabricated into smaller cuts by a fish monger. However, fish butchery may be done on board a fishing vessel and quick-frozen for preservation of quality.[84]

The term "cooking" encompasses a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food. Cooking technique, known as culinary art, generally requires the selection, measurement, and combining of ingredients in an ordered procedure in an effort to achieve the desired result. Constraints on success include the variability of ingredients, ambient conditions, tools, and the skill of the individual cook.[85] The diversity of cooking worldwide is a reflection of the myriad nutritional, aesthetic, agricultural, economic, cultural, and religious considerations that affect it.[86]

Cooking requires applying heat to a food which usually, though not always, chemically changes the molecules, thus changing its flavor, texture, appearance, and nutritional properties.[87] Cooking certain proteins, such as egg whites, meats, and fish, denatures the protein, causing it to firm. There is archaeological evidence of roasted foodstuffs at Homo erectus campsites dating from 420,000 years ago.[88] Boiling as a means of cooking requires a container, and has been practiced at least since the 10th millennium BC with the introduction of pottery.[89]

There are many different types of equipment used for cooking.

Ovens are mostly hollow devices that get very hot (up to 500 °F (260 °C)) and are used for baking or roasting and offer a dry-heat cooking method. Different cuisines will use different types of ovens. For example, Indian culture uses a tandoor oven, which is a cylindrical clay oven which operates at a single high temperature.[90] Western kitchens use variable temperature convection ovens, conventional ovens, toaster ovens, or non-radiant heat ovens like the microwave oven. Classic Italian cuisine includes the use of a brick oven containing burning wood. Ovens may be wood-fired, coal-fired, gas, electric, or oil-fired.[91]

Various types of cook-tops are used as well. They carry the same variations of fuel types as the ovens mentioned above. Cook-tops are used to heat vessels placed on top of the heat source, such as a sauté pan, sauce pot, frying pan, or pressure cooker. These pieces of equipment can use either a moist or dry cooking method and include methods such as steaming, simmering, boiling, and poaching for moist methods, while the dry methods include sautéing, pan frying, and deep-frying.[92]

In addition, many cultures use grills for cooking. A grill operates with a radiant heat source from below, usually covered with a metal grid and sometimes a cover. An open pit barbecue in the American south is one example along with the American style outdoor grill fueled by wood, liquid propane, or charcoal along with soaked wood chips for smoking.[93] A Mexican style of barbecue is called barbacoa, which involves the cooking of meats such as whole sheep over an open fire. In Argentina, an asado (Spanish for "grilled") is prepared on a grill held over an open pit or fire made upon the ground, on which a whole animal or smaller cuts are grilled.[94]

Certain cultures highlight animal and vegetable foods in a raw state. Salads consisting of raw vegetables or fruits are common in many cuisines. Sashimi in Japanese cuisine consists of raw sliced fish or other meat, and sushi often incorporates raw fish or seafood. Steak tartare and salmon tartare are dishes made from diced or ground raw beef or salmon, mixed with various ingredients and served with baguettes, brioche, or frites.[95] In Italy, carpaccio is a dish of very thinly sliced raw beef, drizzled with a vinaigrette made with olive oil.[96] The health food movement known as raw foodism promotes a mostly vegan diet of raw fruits, vegetables, and grains prepared in various ways, including juicing, food dehydration, sprouting, and other methods of preparation that do not heat the food above 118 °F (47.8 °C).[97] An example of a raw meat dish is ceviche, a Latin American dish made with raw meat that is "cooked" from the highly acidic citric juice from lemons and limes along with other aromatics such as garlic.

Restaurants employ chefs to prepare the food, and waiters to serve customers at the table.[98] The term restaurant comes from an old term for a restorative meat broth; this broth (or bouillon) was served in elegant outlets in Paris from the mid 18th century.[99][100] These refined "restaurants" were a marked change from the usual basic eateries such as inns and taverns,[100] and some had developed from early Parisian cafés, such as Café Procope, by first serving bouillon, then adding other cooked food to their menus.[101]

Commercial eateries existed during the Roman period, with evidence of 150 "thermopolia", a form of fast food restaurant, found in Pompeii,[102] and urban sales of prepared foods may have existed in China during the Song dynasty.[103]

In 2005, the population of the United States spent $496 billion on out-of-home dining. Expenditures by type of out-of-home dining were as follows: 40% in full-service restaurants, 37.2% in limited service restaurants (fast food), 6.6% in schools or colleges, 5.4% in bars and vending machines, 4.7% in hotels and motels, 4.0% in recreational places, and 2.2% in others, which includes military bases.[104][better source needed][relevant? – discuss]

Packaged foods are manufactured outside the home for purchase. This can be as simple as a butcher preparing meat, or as complex as a modern international food industry. Early food processing techniques were limited by available food preservation, packaging, and transportation. This mainly involved salting, curing, curdling, drying, pickling, fermenting, and smoking.[105] Food manufacturing arose during the industrial revolution in the 19th century.[106] This development took advantage of new mass markets and emerging technology, such as milling, preservation, packaging and labeling, and transportation. It brought the advantages of pre-prepared time-saving food to the bulk of ordinary people who did not employ domestic servants.[107]

At the start of the 21st century, a two-tier structure has arisen, with a few international food processing giants controlling a wide range of well-known food brands. There also exists a wide array of small local or national food processing companies.[108] Advanced technologies have also come to change food manufacture. Computer-based control systems, sophisticated processing and packaging methods, and logistics and distribution advances can enhance product quality, improve food safety, and reduce costs.[107]

The World Bank reported that the European Union was the top food importer in 2005, followed at a distance by the US and Japan. Britain's need for food was especially well illustrated in World War II. Despite the implementation of food rationing, Britain remained dependent on food imports and the result was a long term engagement in the Battle of the Atlantic.

Food is traded and marketed on a global basis. The variety and availability of food is no longer restricted by the diversity of locally grown food or the limitations of the local growing season.[109] Between 1961 and 1999, there was a 400% increase in worldwide food exports.[110] Some countries are now economically dependent on food exports, which in some cases account for over 80% of all exports.[111]

In 1994, over 100 countries became signatories to the Uruguay Round of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade in a dramatic increase in trade liberalization. This included an agreement to reduce subsidies paid to farmers, underpinned by the WTO enforcement of agricultural subsidy, tariffs, import quotas, and settlement of trade disputes that cannot be bilaterally resolved.[112] Where trade barriers are raised on the disputed grounds of public health and safety, the WTO refer the dispute to the Codex Alimentarius Commission, which was founded in 1962 by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Health Organization. Trade liberalization has greatly affected world food trade.[113]

Food marketing brings together the producer and the consumer. The marketing of even a single food product can be a complicated process involving many producers and companies. For example, fifty-six companies are involved in making one can of chicken noodle soup. These businesses include not only chicken and vegetable processors but also the companies that transport the ingredients and those who print labels and manufacture cans.[114] The food marketing system is the largest direct and indirect non-government employer in the United States.

In the pre-modern era, the sale of surplus food took place once a week when farmers took their wares on market day into the local village marketplace. Here food was sold to grocers for sale in their local shops for purchase by local consumers.[86][107] With the onset of industrialization and the development of the food processing industry, a wider range of food could be sold and distributed in distant locations. Typically early grocery shops would be counter-based shops, in which purchasers told the shop-keeper what they wanted, so that the shop-keeper could get it for them.[86][115]

In the 20th century, supermarkets were born. Supermarkets brought with them a self service approach to shopping using shopping carts, and were able to offer quality food at lower cost through economies of scale and reduced staffing costs. In the latter part of the 20th century, this has been further revolutionized by the development of vast warehouse-sized, out-of-town supermarkets, selling a wide range of food from around the world.[116]

Unlike food processors, food retailing is a two-tier market in which a small number of very large companies control a large proportion of supermarkets. The supermarket giants wield great purchasing power over farmers and processors, and strong influence over consumers. Nevertheless, less than 10% of consumer spending on food goes to farmers, with larger percentages going to advertising, transportation, and intermediate corporations.[117]

It is rare for price spikes to hit all major foods in most countries at once, but food prices suffered all-time peaks in 2008 and 2011, posting a 15% and 12% deflated increase year-over-year, representing prices higher than any data collected.[119] One reason for the increase in food prices may be the increase in oil prices at the same time.[120][121]

In December 2007, 37 countries faced food crises, and 20 had imposed some sort of food-price controls. In China, the price of pork jumped 58% in 2007. In the 1980s and 1990s, farm subsidies and support programs allowed major grain exporting countries to hold large surpluses, which could be tapped during food shortages to keep prices down. However, new trade policies had made agricultural production much more responsive to market demands, putting global food reserves at their lowest since 1983.[122]

Rising food prices in those years have been linked with social unrest around the world, including rioting in Bangladesh and Mexico,[123] and the Arab Spring.[124] Food prices worldwide increased in 2008.[125][126] One cause of rising food prices is wealthier Asian consumers are westernizing their diets, and farmers and nations of the third world are struggling to keep up the pace. The past five years have seen rapid growth in the contribution of Asian nations to the global fluid and powdered milk manufacturing industry, which in 2008 accounted for more than 30% of production, while China alone accounts for more than 10% of both production and consumption in the global fruit and vegetable processing and preserving industry.[127]

In 2013 Overseas Development Institute researchers showed that rice has more than doubled in price since 2000, rising by 120% in real terms. This was as a result of shifts in trade policy and restocking by major producers. More fundamental drivers of increased prices are the higher costs of fertiliser, diesel and labour. Parts of Asia see rural wages rise with potential large benefits for the 1.3 billion (2008 estimate) of Asia's poor in reducing the poverty they face. However, this negatively impacts more vulnerable groups who don't share in the economic boom, especially in Asian and African coastal cities. The researchers said the threat means social-protection policies are needed to guard against price shocks. The research proposed that in the longer run, the rises present opportunities to export for Western African farmers with high potential for rice production to replace imports with domestic production.[128]

Most recently, global food prices have been more stable and relatively low, after a sizable increase in late 2017, they are back under 75% of the nominal value seen during the all-time high in the 2011 food crisis.

As investment
Institutions such as hedge funds, pension funds and investment banks like Barclays Capital, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley[123] have been instrumental in pushing up prices in the last five years, with investment in food commodities rising from $65bn to $126bn (£41bn to £79bn) between 2007 and 2012, contributing to 30-year highs. This has caused price fluctuations which are not strongly related to the actual supply of food, according to the United Nations.[123] Financial institutions now make up 61% of all investment in wheat futures. According to Olivier De Schutter, the UN special rapporteur on food, there was a rush by institutions to enter the food market following George W. Bush's Commodities Futures Modernization Act of 2000.[123] De Schutter told the Independent in March 2012: "What we are seeing now is that these financial markets have developed massively with the arrival of these new financial investors, who are purely interested in the short-term monetary gain and are not really interested in the physical thing – they never actually buy the ton of wheat or maize; they only buy a promise to buy or to sell. The result of this financialisation of the commodities market is that the prices of the products respond increasingly to a purely speculative logic. This explains why in very short periods of time we see prices spiking or bubbles exploding, because prices are less and less determined by the real match between supply and demand."[123] In 2011, 450 economists from around the world called on the G20 to regulate the commodities market more.[123]

Some experts have said that speculation has merely aggravated other factors, such as climate change, competition with bio-fuels and overall rising demand.[123] However, some such as Jayati Ghosh, professor of economics at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, have pointed out that prices have increased irrespective of supply and demand issues: Ghosh points to world wheat prices, which doubled in the period from June to December 2010, despite there being no fall in global supply.[123]

Famine and hunger
Food deprivation leads to malnutrition and ultimately starvation. This is often connected with famine, which involves the absence of food in entire communities. This can have a devastating and widespread effect on human health and mortality. Rationing is sometimes used to distribute food in times of shortage, most notably during times of war.[68]

Starvation is a significant international problem. Approximately 815 million people are undernourished, and over 16,000 children die per day from hunger-related causes.[129] Food deprivation is regarded as a deficit need in Maslow's hierarchy of needs and is measured using famine scales.[130]

Food aid
Main article: Food aid
Food aid can benefit people suffering from a shortage of food. It can be used to improve peoples' lives in the short term, so that a society can increase its standard of living to the point that food aid is no longer required.[131] Conversely, badly managed food aid can create problems by disrupting local markets, depressing crop prices, and discouraging food production. Sometimes a cycle of food aid dependence can develop.[132] Its provision, or threatened withdrawal, is sometimes used as a political tool to influence the policies of the destination country, a strategy known as food politics. Sometimes, food aid provisions will require certain types of food be purchased from certain sellers, and food aid can be misused to enhance the markets of donor countries.[133] International efforts to distribute food to the neediest countries are often coordinated by the World Food Programme.[134]

Foodborne illness, commonly called "food poisoning", is caused by bacteria, toxins, viruses, parasites, and prions. Roughly 7 million people die of food poisoning each year, with about 10 times as many suffering from a non-fatal version.[135] The two most common factors leading to cases of bacterial foodborne illness are cross-contamination of ready-to-eat food from other uncooked foods and improper temperature control. Less commonly, acute adverse reactions can also occur if chemical contamination of food occurs, for example from improper storage, or use of non-food grade soaps and disinfectants. Food can also be adulterated by a very wide range of articles (known as "foreign bodies") during farming, manufacture, cooking, packaging, distribution, or sale. These foreign bodies can include pests or their droppings, hairs, cigarette butts, wood chips, and all manner of other contaminants. It is possible for certain types of food to become contaminated if stored or presented in an unsafe container, such as a ceramic pot with lead-based glaze.[135]

Food poisoning has been recognized as a disease since as early as Hippocrates.[136] The sale of rancid, contaminated, or adulterated food was commonplace until the introduction of hygiene, refrigeration, and vermin controls in the 19th century. Discovery of techniques for killing bacteria using heat, and other microbiological studies by scientists such as Louis Pasteur, contributed to the modern sanitation standards that are ubiquitous in developed nations today. This was further underpinned by the work of Justus von Liebig, which led to the development of modern food storage and food preservation methods.[137] In more recent years, a greater understanding of the causes of food-borne illnesses has led to the development of more systematic approaches such as the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points (HACCP), which can identify and eliminate many risks.[138]

Recommended measures for ensuring food safety include maintaining a clean preparation area with foods of different types kept separate, ensuring an adequate cooking temperature, and refrigerating foods promptly after cooking.[139]

Foods that spoil easily, such as meats, dairy, and seafood, must be prepared a certain way to avoid contaminating the people for whom they are prepared. As such, the rule of thumb is that cold foods (such as dairy products) should be kept cold and hot foods (such as soup) should be kept hot until storage. Cold meats, such as chicken, that are to be cooked should not be placed at room temperature for thawing, at the risk of dangerous bacterial growth, such as Salmonella or E. coli.[140]

Allergies
Main article: Food allergy
Some people have allergies or sensitivities to foods which are not problematic to most people. This occurs when a person's immune system mistakes a certain food protein for a harmful foreign agent and attacks it. About 2% of adults and 8% of children have a food allergy.[141] The amount of the food substance required to provoke a reaction in a particularly susceptible individual can be quite small. In some instances, traces of food in the air, too minute to be perceived through smell, have been known to provoke lethal reactions in extremely sensitive individuals. Common food allergens are gluten, corn, shellfish (mollusks), peanuts, and soy.[141] Allergens frequently produce symptoms such as diarrhea, rashes, bloating, vomiting, and regurgitation. The digestive complaints usually develop within half an hour of ingesting the allergen.[141]

Rarely, food allergies can lead to a medical emergency, such as anaphylactic shock, hypotension (low blood pressure), and loss of consciousness. An allergen associated with this type of reaction is peanut, although latex products can induce similar reactions.[141] Initial treatment is with epinephrine (adrenaline), often carried by known patients in the form of an Epi-pen or Twinject.[142][143]

Other health issues
Human diet was estimated to cause perhaps around 35% of cancers in a human epidemiological analysis by Richard Doll and Richard Peto in 1981.[144] These cancer may be caused by carcinogens that are present in food naturally or as contaminants. Food contaminated with fungal growth may contain mycotoxins such as aflatoxins which may be found in contaminated corn and peanuts. Other carcinogens identified in food include heterocyclic amines generated in meat when cooked at high temperature, polyaromatic hydrocarbons in charred meat and smoked fish, and nitrosamines generated from nitrites used as food preservatives in cured meat such as bacon.[145]

Anticarcinogens that may help prevent cancer can also be found in many food especially fruit and vegetables. Antioxidants are important groups of compounds that may help remove potentially harmful chemicals. It is however often difficult to identify the specific components in diet that serve to increase or decrease cancer risk since many food, such as beef steak and broccoli, contain low concentrations of both carcinogens and anticarcinogens.[145] There are many international certifications in cooking field, such as Monde Selection、A.A. Certification、iTQi. They use the high quality evaluation methods to make the food become more safe.

Cultural and religious diets
Many cultures hold some food preferences and some food taboos. Dietary choices can also define cultures and play a role in religion. For example, only kosher foods are permitted by Judaism, halal foods by Islam, and in Hinduism beef is restricted.[149] In addition, the dietary choices of different countries or regions have different characteristics. This is highly related to a culture's cuisine.

Diet deficiencies
Main article: Avitaminosis
Dietary habits play a significant role in the health and mortality of all humans. Imbalances between the consumed fuels and expended energy results in either starvation or excessive reserves of adipose tissue, known as body fat.[150] Poor intake of various vitamins and minerals can lead to diseases that can have far-reaching effects on health. For instance, 30% of the world's population either has, or is at risk for developing, iodine deficiency.[151] It is estimated that at least 3 million children are blind due to vitamin A deficiency.[152] Vitamin C deficiency results in scurvy.[153] Calcium, Vitamin D, and phosphorus are inter-related; the consumption of each may affect the absorption of the others. Kwashiorkor and marasmus are childhood disorders caused by lack of dietary protein.[154]

Moral, ethical, and health-conscious diets
Many individuals limit what foods they eat for reasons of morality, or other habit. For instance, vegetarians choose to forgo food from animal sources to varying degrees. Others choose a healthier diet, avoiding sugars or animal fats and increasing consumption of dietary fiber and antioxidants.[155] Obesity, a serious problem in the western world, leads to higher chances of developing heart disease, diabetes, cancer and many other diseases.[156] More recently, dietary habits have been influenced by the concerns that some people have about possible impacts on health or the environment from genetically modified food.[157] Further concerns about the impact of industrial farming (grains) on animal welfare, human health, and the environment are also having an effect on contemporary human dietary habits. This has led to the emergence of a movement with a preference for organic and local food.[158]

Between the extremes of optimal health and death from starvation or malnutrition, there is an array of disease states that can be caused or alleviated by changes in diet. Deficiencies, excesses, and imbalances in diet can produce negative impacts on health, which may lead to various health problems such as scurvy, obesity, or osteoporosis, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases as well as psychological and behavioral problems. The science of nutrition attempts to understand how and why specific dietary aspects influence health.

Nutrients in food are grouped into several categories. Macronutrients are fat, protein, and carbohydrates. Micronutrients are the minerals and vitamins. Additionally, food contains water and dietary fiber.

As previously discussed, the body is designed by natural selection to enjoy sweet and fattening foods for evolutionary diets, ideal for hunters and gatherers. Thus, sweet and fattening foods in nature are typically rare and are very pleasurable to eat. In modern times, with advanced technology, enjoyable foods are easily available to consumers. Unfortunately, this promotes obesity in adults and children alike.

Legal definition
Some countries list a legal definition of food, often referring them with the word foodstuff. These countries list food as any item that is to be processed, partially processed, or unprocessed for consumption. The listing of items included as food include any substance intended to be, or reasonably expected to be, ingested by humans. In addition to these foodstuffs, drink, chewing gum, water, or other items processed into said food items are part of the legal definition of food. Items not included in the legal definition of food include animal feed, live animals (unless being prepared for sale in a market), plants prior to harvesting, medicinal products, cosmetics, tobacco and tobacco products, narcotic or psychotropic substances, and residues and contaminants.[159]

Community

A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as norms, religion, values, customs, or identity. Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large.[1][2] Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, "community" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.[3]
The English-language word "community" derives from the Old French comuneté, which comes from the Latin communitas "community", "public spirit" (from Latin communis, "shared in common").[4]
Human communities may share intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.

Archaeology
Archaeological studies of social communities use the term "community" in two ways, paralleling usage in other areas. The first is an informal definition of community as a place where people used to live. In this sense it is synonymous with the concept of an ancient settlement - whether a hamlet, village, town, or city. The second meaning resembles the usage of the term in other social sciences: a community is a group of people living near one another who interact socially. Social interaction on a small scale can be difficult to identify with archaeological data. Most reconstructions of social communities by archaeologists rely on the principle that social interaction in the past was conditioned by physical distance. Therefore, a small village settlement likely constituted a social community, and spatial subdivisions of cities and other large settlements may have formed communities. Archaeologists typically use similarities in material culture—from house types to styles of pottery—to reconstruct communities in the past. This classification method relies on the assumption that people or households will share more similarities in the types and styles of their material goods with other members of a social community than they will with outsiders.[5]
In ecology, a community is an assemblage of populations of different species, interacting with one another. Community ecology is the branch of ecology that studies interactions between and among species. It considers how such interactions, along with interactions between species and the abiotic environment, affect community structure and species richness, diversity and patterns of abundance. Species interact in three ways: competition, predation and mutualism. Competition typically results in a double negative—that is both species lose in the interaction. Predation is a win/lose situation with one species winning. Mutualism, on the other hand, involves both species cooperating in some way, with both winning. The two main types of communities are major which are self-sustaining and self-regulating (such as a forest or a lake) and minor communities which rely on other communities (like fungi decomposing a log) and are the building blocks of major communities.
In Gemeinschaft und Gesellschaft (1887), German sociologist Ferdinand Tönnies described two types of human association: Gemeinschaft (usually translated as "community") and Gesellschaft ("society" or "association"). Tönnies proposed the Gemeinschaft–Gesellschaft dichotomy as a way to think about social ties. No group is exclusively one or the other. Gemeinschaft stress personal social interactions, and the roles, values, and beliefs based on such interactions. Gesellschaft stress indirect interactions, impersonal roles, formal values, and beliefs based on such interactions.[6]
In a seminal 1986 study, McMillan and Chavis[7] identify four elements of "sense of community":
1. membership: feeling of belonging or of sharing a sense of personal relatedness, 2. influence: mattering, making a difference to a group and of the group mattering to its members 3. reinforcement: integration and fulfillment of needs, 4. shared emotional connection.
Ecology
This is a simplified example of a community. A community includes many populations and how they interact with each other. In this example there's an interaction between the zebra and the bush, and the lion and the zebra, as well as the bird and the organisms by the water, like the worms.
Key concepts
Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft
Sense of community
A "sense of community index (SCI) was developed by Chavis and colleagues, and revised and adapted by others. Although originally designed to assess sense of community in neighborhoods, the index has been adapted for use in schools, the workplace, and a variety of types of communities.[8]
Studies conducted by the APPA indicate that young adults who feel a sense of belonging in a community, particularly small communities, develop fewer psychiatric and depressive disorders than those who do not have the feeling of love and belonging.
The process of learning to adopt the behavior patterns of the community is called socialization. The most fertile time of socialization is usually the early stages of life, during which individuals develop the skills and knowledge and learn the roles necessary to function within their culture and social environment.[9] For some psychologists, especially those in the psychodynamic tradition, the most important period of socialization is between the ages of one and ten. But socialization also includes adults moving into a significantly different environment, where they must learn a new set of behaviors.[10]
Socialization is influenced primarily by the family, through which children first learn community norms. Other important influences include schools, peer groups, people, mass media, the workplace, and government. The degree to which the norms of a particular society or community are adopted determines one's willingness to engage with others. The norms of tolerance, reciprocity, and trust are important "habits of the heart," as de Tocqueville put it, in an individual's involvement in community.[11]
Community development is often linked with community work or community planning, and may involve stakeholders, foundations, governments, or contracted entities including non-government organisations (NGOs), universities or government agencies to progress the social well-being of local, regional and, sometimes, national communities. More grassroots efforts, called community building or community organizing, seek to empower individuals and groups of people by providing them with the skills they need to effect change in their own communities.[12] These skills often assist in building political power through the formation of large social groups working for a common agenda. Community development practitioners must understand both how to work with individuals and how to affect communities' positions within the context of larger social institutions. Public administrators, in contrast, need to understand community development in the context of rural and urban development, housing and economic development, and community, organizational and business development.
Formal accredited programs conducted by universities, as part of degree granting institutions, are often used to build a knowledge base to drive curricula in public administration, sociology and community studies. The General Social Survey from the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago and the Saguaro Seminar at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University are examples of national community development in the United States. The Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University in New York State offers core courses in community and economic development, and in areas ranging from non-profit development to US budgeting (federal to
Community development
local, community funds). In the United Kingdom, Oxford University has led in providing extensive research in the field through its Community Development Journal,[13] used worldwide by sociologists and community development practitioners.
At the intersection between community development and community building are a number of programs and organizations with community development tools. One example of this is the program of the Asset Based Community Development Institute of Northwestern University. The institute makes available downloadable tools[14] to assess community assets and make connections between non-profit groups and other organizations that can help in community building. The Institute focuses on helping communities develop by "mobilizing neighborhood assets" – building from the inside out rather than the outside in.[15] In the disability field, community building was prevalent in the 1980s and 1990s with roots in John McKnight's approaches.[16][17]
In The Different Drum: Community-Making and Peace (1987) Scott Peck argues that the almost accidental sense of community that exists at times of crisis can be consciously built. Peck believes that conscious community building is a process of deliberate design based on the knowledge and application of certain rules.[18] He states that this process goes through four stages:[19]
1. Pseudocommunity: When people first come together, they try to be "nice" and present what they feel are their most personable and friendly characteristics. 2. Chaos: People move beyond the inauthenticity of pseudo-community and feel safe enough to present their "shadow" selves. 3. Emptiness: Moves beyond the attempts to fix, heal and convert of the chaos stage, when all people become capable of acknowledging their own woundedness and brokenness, common to human beings. 4. True community: Deep respect and true listening for the needs of the other people in this community. In 1991, Peck remarked that building a sense of community is easy but maintaining this sense of community is difficult in the modern world.[20]
The three basic types of community organizing are grassroots organizing, coalition building, and "institution-based community organizing," (also called "broad-based community organizing," an example of which is faith-based community organizing, or Congregation-based Community Organizing).[21]
Community building can use a wide variety of practices, ranging from simple events (e.g., potlucks, small book clubs) to larger-scale efforts (e.g., mass festivals, construction projects that involve local participants rather than outside contractors).
Community building that is geared toward citizen action is usually termed "community organizing."[22] In these cases, organized community groups seek accountability from elected officials and increased direct representation within decision-making bodies. Where good-faith negotiations fail, these constituency-led organizations seek to pressure the decision-makers through a variety of means, including picketing, boycotting, sit-ins, petitioning, and electoral politics.
Community organizing can focus on more than just resolving specific issues. Organizing often means building a widely accessible power structure, often with the end goal of distributing power equally throughout the community. Community organizers generally seek to build groups that are open and democratic in governance. Such groups facilitate and

encourage consensus decision-making with a focus on the general health of the community rather than a specific interest group.
If communities are developed based on something they share in common, whether location or values, then one challenge for developing communities is how to incorporate individuality and differences. Rebekah Nathan suggests in her book, My Freshman Year, we are drawn to developing communities totally based on sameness, despite stated commitments to diversity, such as those found on university websites.
Some communities have developed their own local exchange trading systems (LETS)[23] and local currencies, such as the Ithaca Hours system,[24] to encourage economic growth and an enhanced sense of community. Community currencies have recently proven valuable in meeting the needs of people living in various South American nations, particularly Argentina, that recently suffered as a result of the collapse of the Argentinian national currency.[25]
A number of ways to categorize types of community have been proposed. One such breakdown is as follows:
1. Location-based Communities: range from the local neighbourhood, suburb, village, town or city, region, nation or even the planet as a whole. These are also called communities of place. 2. Identity-based Communities: range from the local clique, sub-culture, ethnic group, religious, multicultural or pluralistic civilisation, or the global community cultures of today. They may be included as communities of need or identity, such as disabled persons, or frail aged people. 3. Organizationally based Communities: range from communities organized informally around family or network-based guilds and associations to more formal incorporated associations, political decision making structures, economic enterprises, or professional associations at a small, national or international scale. The usual categorizations of community relations have a number of problems:[26] (1) they tend to give the impression that a particular community can be defined as just this kind or another; (2) they tend to conflate modern and customary community relations; (3) they tend to take sociological categories such as ethnicity or race as given, forgetting that different ethnically defined persons live in different kinds of communities — grounded, interest-based, diasporic, etc.[27]
In response to these problems, Paul James and his colleagues have developed a taxonomy that maps community relations, and recognizes that actual communities can be characterized by different kinds of relations at the same time:[28]
1. Grounded community relations. This involves enduring attachment to particular places and particular people. It is the dominant form taken by customary and tribal communities. In these kinds of communities, the land is fundamental to identity. 2. Life-style community relations. This involves giving primacy to communities coming together around particular chosen ways of life, such as morally charged or interest-based relations or just living or working in the same location. Hence the following sub-forms: 1. community-life as morally bounded, a form taken by many traditional faith-based communities. 2. community-life as interest-based, including sporting, leisure-based and business communities which come together for regular moments of engagement.

3. community-life as proximately-related, where neighbourhood or commonality of association forms a community of convenience, or a community of place (see below). 3. Projected community relations. This is where a community is self-consciously treated as an entity to be projected and re-created. It can be projected as through thin advertising slogan, for example gated community, or can take the form of ongoing associations of people who seek political integration, communities of practice[29] based on professional projects, associative communities which seek to enhance and support individual creativity, autonomy and mutuality. A nation is one of the largest forms of projected or imagined community. In these terms, communities can be nested and/or intersecting; one community can contain another—for example a location-based community may contain a number of ethnic communities.[30] Both lists above can used in a cross-cutting matrix in relation to each other.
In general, virtual communities value knowledge and information as currency or social resource.[31][32][33][34] What differentiates virtual communities from their physical counterparts is the extent and impact of "weak ties," which are the relationships acquaintances or strangers form to acquire information through online networks.[35] Relationships among members in a virtual community tend to focus on information exchange about specific topics.[36][37] A survey conducted by Pew Internet and The American Life Project in 2001 found those involved in entertainment, professional, and sports virtual groups focused their activities on obtaining information.[38]
An epidemic of bullying and harassment has arisen from the exchange of information between strangers, especially among teenagers,[39] in virtual communities. Despite attempts to implement anti-bullying policies, Sheri Bauman, professor of counselling at the University of Arizona, claims the "most effective strategies to prevent bullying" may cost companies revenue.[40]



The above case of Florida State Geologist Elias Sellards demonstrates that the study of
“human antiquity” or man’s earliest origins is one surrounded by passion, controversy, and
a deep well of curiosity. Our curiosity about our earliest origins has not only given birth to
fictional characters like Indiana Jones and Captain Kirk, but also is largely responsible for the
growth of archaeology in the early twentieth century. Western scholars and explorers were
1 David J. Meltzer, The Great Paleolithic War: How Science Forged an Understanding of America’s Ice Age Past (Chicago:
University of Chicago Press, 2015), 1.
Page | 2
not content with simply reaching remote places; they were curious about their earliest human
inhabitants. While the motives of early excavators may have been quite simple (Well-known
paleoanthropologist Richard Leakey got his start collecting stones as a child), archaeologists
and paleoanthropologists eventually created an entirely new field of historical investigation:
prehistory. Multiple pioneers have hacked through underbrush or spent months excavating
Paleolithic sites. Not until recently, however, have scientific advances, local knowledge, and
anthropological theory merged with the curiosity of western explorers to craft a more accurate
version of human origins and evolution.
Written texts are the primary sources most historians are trained to work with and are those
they are most comfortable using. However, if we are to understand humanity’s origins, we have
to recognize that written language is a relatively recent invention (around 5,000 years old);
therefore, much of what we know about human beginnings must be borrowed from the findings
of colleagues in other disciplines like geology, botany, and archaeology. In all of the regions
mentioned below, archaeologists have excavated and analyzed physical evidence relating to our
pre-historic ancestors. Up until recent times, though, it was difficult to understand migration
patterns and chronology without a method to determine the age of anything from a human skull
to a cutting tool. Archaeologists in the 1930s and 40s used imprecise terms like “stone bowl
cultures,” a nomenclature that referred more to the details of the articles unearthed than their
historical context.2
 This began to change with the advent of radiocarbon dating or C14 dating in the
1940s. Through this method, we were able to place thousands of organic archaeological materials
in their proper historical context even without textual evidence. For artifacts over 40,000 years
old, the amount of radioactive carbon we can recover doesn’t permit accurate measurement.
However, we do have a number of techniques to trace human origins even further back, including
aerial photography, side-scanning radar, and potassium-argon dating. All these techniques get
around the lack of radioactive carbon in that they don’t date the organic material, but instead the
terrain in which they were found, allowing us to trace human origins back millions of years to the
beginnings of bipedalism.
The goal of this chapter, though, is not to trace human evolution from its beginnings, but
to set the scene for the beginnings of civilization. In this chapter we will explore why hominids
moved, how they survived, and how they came to develop agriculture. We also hope to lay out why
humans in far flung parts of the world responded similarly to changing conditions around them
and hence developed civilizations at roughly the same time.
This chapter begins at the origins of bipedalism some eight million years ago and brings us up
to eight thousand years ago with the the Neolithic Era or “new stone age.” Bipedal hominids would
develop during the Pliocene era and our closest ancestors during the more recent Pleistocene.
Finally, modern Homo sapiens would appear during the Holocene. During the Holocene
humans would perfect tool usage during the Paleolithic Era, and would usher in agriculture during
the Neolithic. Our chapter ends as humans prepare to enter the Bronze and Iron Ages.

1.5 HUMAN BEGINNINGS IN AFRICA
The fossil record in Africa clearly establishes that a human lineage diverged there from African
apes sometime between eight to six million years ago. Beginning as far back as eight million years
ago, various species of hominids (the ancestors of modern humans or Homo sapiens) began to
walk upright. This bipedalism would allow these hominids to use their hands to develop, craft, and
use tools. Bipedalism would also eventually contribute to a move out of forests into the savanna
and turn hominids into big game hunters and gatherers. Paleoanthropologists once theorized
that hominids became bipedal to adapt to life in the grasslands. However, the fact that fossils of
bipedal hominids were found alongside fossil remains of wood, seeds, and other forest dwellers
has cast some doubt on that theory. In fact, bipedal hominids may have lived in the forest for 
Page | 4
some time. While some bipedal hominids may have stayed in the forest, climate changes did drive
others to move into new areas within Africa and beyond it.
1.5.1 Climate, Hominin in Evolution, and Migrations
As far as thirty million years ago hominids were reacting to changes in their environment.
(“Hominids” refers to all Great Apes including humans and their ancestors. “Hominins” is often
used when speaking more specifically
about modern humans and their more
recently extinct ancestors. We will use
“hominids” here because it covers all of
the groups we will reference including
modern humans). The earth cooled,
producing more fragmented environments. As already mentioned, some
hominids may have stayed in the trees,
but those that left the forest began to
thrive in grasslands. These savannas
and prairies expanded during the
Miocene, the geologic era lasting from
24 – 2 million years ago. This grassland
expansion prompted baboons and
hominids to move out of the forest.
During the Pliocene epoch (5 – 1.6
million years ago), another series of environmental changes made these grasslands even more prevalent, leading to a
transformation that geologists call the
“turnover-pulse hypothesis.” Animals
with adaptations such as angled knee
joints and arched feet survived on the
grasslands, while those with longer arms
or curved fingers who were better suited
to the woodlands did not. For hominids,
this favorable grassland environment meant the “development of several closely related species.
Large-toothed hominids known as robust australopithecines appeared in Southern and Eastern
Africa.” 3
 Towards the end of the Pliocene, around 2.4 million years ago, the first members of our
genus—homo (Homo habilis)—appeared, the first hominid to make stone tools.
The Pleistocene epoch (1.6 million – 10,000 years ago) saw at least twenty-five periods
of glaciation and warming. Glaciation resulted from dips in global temperature which had two

CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY
major effects on hominid development. First, with sea levels dropping due to glaciation, hominids
migrated to Australia and the Americas for the first time. Second, while many migrated out of
colder climates, those that remained developed physical adaptations. Homo neanderthalensis
(Neaderthals), a hominid that disappeared 28,000 years ago, became stockier and more powerful
to deal with the difficulties of this icy climate.
While not as dramatic as previous developments, the current Holocene period has seen its
share of significant climatic events. The Younger Dryas event (c. 12,000 BCE) was a drop in global
temperatures accompanied by a corresponding change in vegetation distribution. Reduced rainfall
from 2200 – 1900 BCE made conditions very difficult for civilizations in the Eastern Mediterranean.
Finally, the Medieval Warm Period represents “one of the most recent periods of climate change.”4
Like neanderthalensis, Homo sapiens, Homo erectus, Homo habilis, and other
hominids all reacted to changing climate conditions. Homo erectus and Homo habilis migrated,
hunted, and used fire, while neanderthalensis had some use of language and tools and buried their
dead. For millions of years, in fact, hominids had been using slivers of volcanic stone and cutters
probably to hack through animal skin. The cutters were often found close together, suggesting
that early hominids even had a division of labor between hunters who would have to pursue their
prey and butchers who could wait nearby at the butchering site. There is even evidence of task
division by gender among neanderthalensis. Multiple sites in Europe show different patterns of
wear on male and female teeth, indicating a gendered task division in tasks where teeth were used
to hold, break, or strip objects.5
However, by 25,000 years ago all other hominins were extinct; only Homo sapiens sapiens,
our species, survived. Paleoanthropologists attribute this survival to larger brains, durability, and
ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. Based on migration patterns and archaeological evidence, Homo sapiens sapiens appear to have been the only hominids to build sea-worthy boats, create art, have organized religion, and live in any climate.6
1.5.2 Homo sapiens Migration
While Homo sapiens were decidedly more advanced than other hominids, when they first
moved out of Africa some 45,000 years ago, they were only equipped with stone tools for hunting
and cutting. Despite those initial limitations, 30,000 years later Homo sapiens would inhabit
almost every environment on earth and had a presence in every continent except Antarctica. Homo
sapiens in fact moved further and faster than all other hominids. While it is hard to attribute a
single factor to all Homo sapiens migration, we do see that multiple human societies required
migration to arrive at a more sophisticated level of development. Homo sapien migration accelerated close to 40,000 years ago, where humans reached continental Eurasia.
Modern humans (50,000 – 10,000 years ago) completed the migration to all the continents
except Antartica, moving first into Australia, Eastern Siberia, the Pacific margins, Japan, and the

Americas. Then from 10,000 years ago to 1,500 CE, humans arrived in the Arctic, the Indian Ocean,
the deep Pacific, and tropical rain forests. Migration occurred in a “staccato” pattern with “easiest”
areas colonized quickly, while more “difficult” areas remained uninhabited for thousands of years.
A region’s “easiness” is calculated from estimates about available plant and animal biomass and
net productivity—that is, how quickly it returns—in each habitat. For example, tropical savannas
and grasslands of East Africa were colonized first as the biomass there sustained the first bipedal
hominids.
Hominids first left “sub-Saharan Africa … through the northern savannahs, up the Nile corridor
or across the straits of Bab el Mandeb to the Arabian Peninsula.” 7 Evidence exists of Homo erectus in
Morocco, Chad, and Algeria, and it appears that they eventually left Africa via the Arabian Peninsula.
After leaving Africa about 1.5 million years ago, choppers, handaxes, and spheroids found at sites
like Ubeidiya in Israel put Homo erectus in the Levant. Some scholars argue for the existence of a
second migration out of Africa and into the Jordan Valley 500 to 600 thousand years ago.
Asia
Some evidence suggests the presence of Homo ergaster and Homo erectus as having occurred
in Java over a million years ago. Chinese Homo erectus fossils date between 800,000 to 400,000
years ago. Homo sapiens began to leave Africa around 40,000 years ago, and hunter gatherers
appeared in China by the end of the last Ice Age (36,000 to 16,000 BCE) as continental ice in
central Asia began to melt.

CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY
Europe
Animal bones and pebble tools place hominids near Rome just before the beginning of the
Middle Pleistocene (730,000 years ago). This seems to be the first hominid incursion into
Europe. Hominid remains in Spain suggest colonization in Iberia up to two million years ago,
but there are not nearly enough remains (no more than twenty inhabitants in any given site) to
provide any certainty in terms of which hominids they correspond to or when they lived there.
Either way, colonization of Europe can be considered “late.” This tardiness may have been related
to a lack of animal food sources. Not until around 500,000 years ago did “new species of deer,
bovid, rhino, and horse appear” 8 in Europe. Around the same time, the cheetah, saber-tooth tiger,
and dirk-tooth cat declined in the region, making more carcasses from the aforementioned species
available to hominid foragers.
Australia, Papua New Guinea, Sahul
Evidence of tools from 30,000 years ago exists in Australia, and from even longer in New
Guinea. The lack of “a dry land crossing to Sahul” (the land mass that once connected New Guinea
and Australia) meant that an ocean journey of somewhere between sixty-five and 100 kilometers
was required from mainland Asia. This made Australians and New Guineans the first sea-going
colonizers. Once in Sahul, how humans populated Australia is still the subject of some debate
between those who support the “coastal hugger” theory and those who support the idea of population by “overlanders.” The more difficult of the two means of populating Australia is overland,
as it is more arid than the coasts, and the evidence for tools overland is not as advanced as that
for the coast.
Peopling the New World
North and South America were the last continents to be settled by humans. Most scholars think
that the Americas were populated from Beringia over land. Around 12,000 years ago, mammoth
hunting became more common and supported larger populations on both the Asian and American
sides of Beringia, a landmass (now divided by the Bering Strait) which at that time connected
North America and Asia. On the Asian side, outlines of houses with stone-lined hearths have been
found, remnants indicating permanent settlement that didn’t necessarily have colonization as an
end goal. But colonize they did, one group pushing southward between 10,000 and 3,000 years
ago and establishing settlements that would become the origins of modern Korean, Japanese,
Chinese, and Inuit populations. Another group migrated southeastward through Alaska, their
descendants making it as far as Chile and Argentina.
While we know about when American colonization began, the pace and means of colonization are still debated. Complicating the discussion of timing is the fact that the Late Wisconsin
Ice sheet blocked the overland route from about 30,000 years ago, when two sheets merged,
up until about 12,000 years ago, when they opened after a thaw. At this point in time, only a
handful of sites support possible pre-10,000 BCE occupation: Monte Verde in Chile, Meadowcraft
near Pittsburgh, and Page-Ladson in Florida. As recently as 2015, excavations at Monte Verde and

Chinchihuapi have strengthened the “possibility of an earlier human presence on the continent”
to as far back as 17,000 BCE. This date has continued to move back in time as archeologists
consider evidence of more mobile humans who did not leave large artifact clusters because of
their ephemeral nature, but nonetheless may have been present before more sedentary groups.
For now, however, the
clearest evidence for when
the Americas were widely
populated comes through
the Clovis point, a specific
arrowhead shape that was
unique in its ubiquity and sophistication. The Clovis point
was also found in mammoths
that had grown extinct by
10,500 years ago, this discovery
meaning that humans were
common in North America by
then. From Beringia, humans
moved at a rate of roughly 10
miles a year until they reached
Tierra del Fuego and fully
populated the Americas (with
the exception of some tropical
areas mentioned above).9
The Arctic
The first Paleo-Eskimo populations appeared around 4,000 years ago after arriving from
Eastern Siberia, populations that were left behind by the American colonists already mentioned.
The Arctic climate is harsh, to say the least, and these populations needed sophisticated weapons
and tools to be able to survive it, which explains their late arrival.
The Arctic colonists expanded rapidly across Alaska, through Canada, and into Greenland,
assisted by their arctic “small tool kits” that included the important toggle headed harpoons to
kill walrus and seal.
Polynesian origins
The origins of Polynesian humans are still very much in doubt. Groups of Polynesian mariners
had existed 50,000 years ago, but they were not colonizers. In fact, many scholars argue that
eventual colonization actually began as exploration. Around 2,500 years ago, we see more
permanent settlements in Fiji, Tonga, and other areas of the “remote” Pacific, as remnants of pottery

have been found there. Based on linguistic and technological similarities among
Polynesian cultures, some scholars
argue that Fiji, Somoa, and Tonga were a
crucible of sorts where Polynesians were
“made” from groups from throughout
Asia. Once these cultural groups had a
certain identity, they began to colonize
Easter Island, Hawaii, and New Zealand
about and beyond 1,000 CE.
We can’t use land migration patterns
to understand oversea migration. The
Pacific was somewhat of a highway,
where currents and winds were wellknown and frequently used by mariners.
Migrating humans were much more
likely to wander aimlessly on land than
they were to let currents take them to
unknown parts of the ocean. Pacific
mariners tacked to use the winds in their
favor and, despite population pressures,
Pacific mariners were too adept at
seafaring to suggest a simple casting out of people into the Pacific in hopes of finding something.
Once Pacific colonization did commence, settlers were very deliberate about it, taking with them
families, and plants, and animals. It seems that they had every intention of recreating “home.” In
sum, the exploration was neither extremely heroic nor extremely risky but instead was calculated
and not left to chance.
1.5.3 Hunter-gatherers
Chapter Two explores the importance of farming to the creation and expansion of early civilizations. However, farming was only invented 13,000 years ago, meaning that for most of human
history, our food has come through foraging. Early hominids like australopithecines, Homo
habilis, and Homo erectus ate mostly plant food. Homo sapiens became more sophisticated
foragers as they began to fish with hooks and, more recently, nets, and as they used stone grinding
tools to produce flour.
As food gathering techniques evolved for these Paleolithic foragers, so did their behavior as
organized groups. Modern humans became mobile to prevent resource depletion; they controlled
population through dispersion or infanticide, and they began to “live and work cooperatively.”
Modern foragers also began to divide tasks and share food with others, a feature that distinguishes them from other animals like chimpanzees that live in communities but feed individually.

Sharing food is, of course, much easier to do when there is a surplus, and, with increasing tool
use, Paleolithic humans became even more adept at foraging, leading to the higher likelihood of
food surpluses.
Tool use not only helped humans live cooperatively, but it also may have helped hominids
develop abstract thought—evidence of tool use may give us a clue as to when this development
began. We know that other animals use tools, but even as long as 2.6 million years ago, we see
evidence of the creative thinking required to make more effective tools. Homo habilis in fact
takes its name (“handy man”) from the fact that they were the first known hominid tool-makers.
Soon after individual tools appeared, the Oldowan Industry became the first widely used toolset,
“consisting of flaked and smashed quartz
riverside pebbles made into poorly formed
choppers and sharp stone flakes, [and]
lasted for 1 million years with little change
[from 2.6 to 1.5 million years ago].” 10 The
Oldowan were followed about 1.5 million
years ago by hand axes that remained
unchanged for more than a million years.
Many scholars argue that these smaller-brained hominids like Homo habilis,
homo ergaster, and Australopithecus
were both unable and unwilling to
innovate much beyond their simple but
effective tools, especially considering how
harsh their environment could become.
Fire was another important tool, first
used by Homo erectus about 1.6 million
years ago. Fire would become important
to migrants to colder climes in Europe
and Asia and to foragers who could now
eat foods that were poisonous if ingested raw. Homo erectus also cooked foods they had previously
eaten raw, thereby expanding their lifespan by eliminating toxins found in raw meats.
Homo sapiens would add more meat to their diet when advances in tool-making led to an
increase in big game hunting during the late Pleistocene. For example, excavations near Dolni
Vetoniçe in the Czech Republic have helped reveal a society that “used mammoth remains not
only for meat, but for fuel, construction, jewelry, and portable art.” The inhabitants of Dolni
Vetoniçe also made thousands of ceramic figurines, bird bone flutes, and ivory carvings of human
heads. The cave paintings of Lascaux also reflect this increased skill as hunters and painters both.
The colors and types of paint they used were vibrant and durable, and the scenes they depicted
demonstrated their use of diverse hunting techniques. There we see depictions of humans hunting
not only deer, but also woolly rhinoceros and mammoths.

CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY
Also at Lascaux, we see evidence that hunter-gatherers had both religious beliefs and gender
specific tasks, reflecting a sophistication that we usually only attribute to sedentary humans. The
fact the humans and animals were depicted together so often at Lascaux may be evidence of a
belief that man descended from these animals. Or perhaps the bison, rhinoceri, and birds were
painted on the walls to produce “hunting magic” designed to make expeditions more successful.
Finally, it was mostly men depicted in these higher-risk hunting activities, suggesting that women
were the artists, participated less in the hunt, or both.
Closer to the Neolithic era, societies began to experience a growing role for women reflected
through their representation in “Venus” statuettes. (See Figure 1.5) As we get closer to the Neolithic
era, we see the relative role of women increasing; their place in ritual increases, their stature
increases, their economic importance increases, and their childbearing uniqueness becomes more
greatly emphasized.
Increased sophistication was not limited to big
game hunters, however.
Campsites, rock art, and
burial sites near Lake
Mungo in Australia reveal
how these early humans
used pottery for cooking
and had a diverse diet of
birds, fish, and shellfish,
a diet that seems to have
kept them well-nourished.
11 Australia was a society
of hunter-gatherers until
European colonization.
Mobility was essential,
with the continent’s lack
of widespread rainfall and
rich soil. As a result, aboriginal Australians needed
an extensive knowledge of
their terrain and where to move when. Tasmanians would ambush wallabies at their seasonal
grazing territory, while aborigines in the central deserts had to know when water holes would go
dry. We also learn from the remains of Australian aborigines that foragers could be quite complex
if they continued to hunt and gather for thousands of years. Aborigines painted, developed
advanced weapons like the boomerang, warred against one another, developed creation myths,
passed down oral histories, and played musical instruments.

1.6 AGRICULTURE AND THE “NEOLITHIC REVOLUTION”
Historian Lauren Ristvet defines agriculture as the “‘domestication’ of plants… causing it to
change genetically from its wild ancestor in ways [that make] it more useful to human consumers.”12 She and hundreds of other scholars from Hobbes to Marx have pointed to the Neolithic
Revolution, that is, the move from a hunter-gatherer world to an agricultural one, as the root of
what we today refer to as civilization. Without agriculture we don’t have empires, written language,
factories, universities, or railroads. Despite its importance, much remains unclear about why and
where agriculture began. Instead, scholars hold a handful of well-regarded theories about the
roots (pun intended) of agriculture.
Most scholars agree that the Ice Age played a fundamental role in the rise of agriculture,
in the sense that it was impossible during the much colder and often tundra-covered period of
the Pleistocene, but inevitable during the Holocene thawing. Only 4,000 years before the origins
of agriculture, the planting of anything would have been an exercise in futility. During the Last
Glacial Maximum (24,000 – 16,000 years ago), average temperatures dropped “by as much as
57˚ F near the great ice sheets…”13
of Spain or the North American Great Plains were increasingly covered in ice, but also that other
areas around the world could not depend on constant temperatures or rainfall from year to year.
Pleistocene foragers had to be flexible. The warming trend of the Holocene, by contrast, resulted
in consistent rainfall amounts and more predictable temperatures. The warming also altered the
habitats of the megafauna that humans hunted, alterations that in some cases contributed to their
extinction. Therefore, as animal populations declined, humans were further encouraged to plant
and cultivate seeds in newly-thawed soil.
 This glaciation meant not only that today’s fertile farmlands
When we start to examine other factors that allowed humans to transition to agriculture, we
find that the climate factor looms even larger. For example, agriculture was usually accompanied by sedentarism, but we see communal living and permanent settlements among multiple
groups of hunter-gatherers. Homo sapiens had also begun to domesticate animals and plants
alike during the Pleistocene. Humans were already being buried alongside dogs as early as 14,000
years ago.14 As we’ll see below, gatherers were developing an increasing taste for grains long
before they would abandon a foraging lifestyle. Essentially, humans were ready for agriculture
when climate permitted it.
We discuss elsewhere the timing of agriculture’s appearance in all of the continents, but
generally speaking by about 8,000 years ago, farmers in West Asia were growing rye, barley, and
wheat. In northern China, millet was common 8,500 years ago. In the Americas, the domestication
of maize began around 8,000 years ago in Mesoamerica, while at about the same time, Andean
residents began cultivating potatoes. Once all of these areas realized agriculture’s potential as a
permanent food source, they began to adapt their societies to increase their crop consistency and
crop yields. We’ll discuss how agriculture affected societal development below.

CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY
1.6.1 First farmers of West Asia [or the Fertile Crescent]
In later chapters we will discuss Mesopotamia, the area between the Euphrates and Tigris Rivers
that agriculture would make the “cradle of civilization.” (See Map 2.1). However, the incubator of
Mesopotamian and Fertile Crescent agriculture and cultural patterns dated back to the foragers of
the nearby Eastern Mediterranean, thousands of
years before. The rye, barley, and wheat in West
Asia were first harvested by late Pleistocene
foragers called the Kebarans who ground wild
wheat and barley into a porridge.15 Kebarans
consumed the porridge as part of their broad
spectrum diet that also included land mammals,
birds, and fish. Advancing into the Holocene
we see the “Natufian Adaptation,” where
residents of this same area began to see the
benefits of sedentary living in a precursor to the
advent of agriculture. The Natufians consumed
the same rye, barley, and wheat that their
Kebaran predecessors had, but because their
teeth were well-worn it appears they ate relatively more of it. Having a constant source of these
grains enabled their eschewing long hunting
or gathering soujourns; instead, the Natufians
drew more of their meat from in and around
Lake Huleh in modern Israel. Near Lake Huleh
was Ain Mallaha, one of the earliest examples of
year-round human settlement and an important
precursor to sedentary agriculture.
Another permanent settlement in Southwest Asia seems to have been more directly responsible for the decision to actually domesticate grain, rather than simply cultivate wild varieties.
Abu Hureya in Syria was deeply affected by the Younger Dryas event of 11,000 years ago, an
event which caused many of their wild food staples to disappear. Rather than migrating out of the
area, the Abu Hureyrans cultivated rye. Soon afterward, other sites in the Levant began to see the
planting of barley, while wheat was cultivated in both the Levant and Anatolia.16
1.6.2 First Permanent Settlements in West Asia [of the Fertile Crescent]
The transition from foraging, to collecting to cultivating took place over several centuries, but
these gradual changes did serve to mark a very distinct era of permanent settlement during the
Neolithic Period. Increased rainfall around 9600 BCE meant that the Jordan River would swell

yearly, in the process depositing layers of fertile soil
along its banks. This fertile soil allowed locals to rely
on agriculture for survival. Soon after they founded
Jericho just north of the Dead Sea: “perhaps the
very first time in human history that a completely viable population was living in the same place
at the same time.”17 By Jericho’s height, around
9000 BCE, the settlements population reached the
hundreds. This increase cannot be considered an
urban boom of course, and the transition away from
foraging occurred gradually. For example, excavations from this area have unearthed no separation
of tasks or dwellings by gender or skill. However,
by the end of Jericho’s development, maintaining large populations in one place would prove to
produce other extensive adjustments.18
Jericho’s residents did distinguish themselves
from their hunter-gatherer predecessors, however,
through their relatively extensive construction
projects. They used mud bricks to build a wall that
encircled the settlement probably for flood control,
a tower, and separate buildings for grain storage.
The former foragers now living at Jericho could rely on fish or other aquatic creatures for
meat as they experimented with permanent settlement, but those foragers living further away
from large bodies of water would need another source of meat. This need increasingly was met
by animal domestication. Domestication would prove to be a slow process, as humans learned
the hard way that zebras bite, impalas are claustrophobic, and bighorn sheep do not obey orders.
In other words, some animals cannot be domesticated, but this is information only understood through trial and error. By about 7,500 BCE, however, humans in the Taurus and Zagros
mountains employed selective breeding to eventually domesticate mountain sheep and goats. The
temperament and size of pigs and cows delayed their domestication until the 6,000s BCE, but this
process proved equally, if not more important, than that of sheep and goats.
As agriculture and animal domestication progressed, settlements around the Mediterranean
became larger and more sophisticated. By 7,000 BCE on the Anatolian plateau, Çatalhüyük
reached several thousands of inhabitants. The residents at Çatalhüyük buried their dead, constructed uniform adjacent houses with elaborate designs painted on their interior walls, and
had multiple workshops where (among other activities) they wove baskets, and made obsidian
mirrors as well as daggers with “carved bone handles.”19 Catalhüyük denizens wove wool into

cloth; developed a varied diet of peas, nuts, vegetable oil, apples, honey, and the usual grains;
and improved weapons technology with sharper arrows added to their use of daggers and lances.
These gains may seem modest by our standards, but the legacy of communal living and, ultimately, political centralization that they introduced was extraordinary.
Jericho and Çatalhüyük were surely some of the most notable early settlements, but they were
not alone. The appearance of these two settlements was accompanied by the increasing presence
of village life across the world. Most early agricultural villages in Southwest Asia and around the
world were very similar in appearance; they had around twenty residents and were organized
around grain cultivation and storage. Small huts were organized in a “loose circle,” and grain silos
were placed between each hut. Labor was a communal activity, and village members all spent
time hoeing the fields or hunting. The most valuable asset to a community was the grain itself, but
neither it nor the land where it grew it belonged to one individual.
This model existed for hundreds and even thousands of years in some areas, until the villages
stopped hunting and domesticated animals. For many scholars, the abandonment of hunting
represents the “real” Neolithic Revolution. As communities completely abandoned hunting and

gathering, they dedicated more energy to warfare, religion, and construction; in consequence,
dwellings and settlements grew, along with a concomitant focus on tool and weapon making.20
1.6.3 Leaving Paleolithic Culture Behind
While the Neolithic Era is described in greater detail elsewhere, it is important to understand
Paleolithic and Neolithic differences in order to convey a sense of just how revolutionary the shift
to agriculture was for humanity. For example, agriculture contributed to (along with religion and
trade) the development of class. Before agriculture,
hunter-gatherers divided tasks like seed gathering,
grinding, or tool-making. However, without large scale
building projects like aqueducts or canals required
for agriculture, hierarchies were much less pronounced. The intensification of agriculture during the
Neolithic required irrigation, plowing, and terracing,
all of which were labor intensive. The amount of
labor required could not be met through simple task
division; someone had to be in charge. This meant the
establishment of ruling elites, a societal grouping that
had not existed during the Paleolithic.
While violence certainly existed during the
Paleolithic period, organized warfare was an invention
of the Neolithic. Agriculture meant larger populations and settlements that were more tightly packed
and closer to one another. These closer quarters
created new social and economic pressures that could
produce organized violence. Agricultural intensification produced stores of food and valuables that could
be seized by neighbors. During the 9,000s BCE, settlements like Jericho began to build defensive walls,
while skeletons unearthed in the area reveal wounds
from new types of projectiles (like the Khiam Point)
developed during the era.21
Family life also changed significantly during the
Neolithic. Sedentary communities invested more time
and resources into the construction of permanent homes
housing nuclear families. People spent less time with the community as a whole and within homes it
became easier to accumulate wealth and keep secrets.
The shift in gender roles after agriculture seems to be even more pronounced, as the role of
women became more important as humans moved out of the Paleolithic and into the Neolithic era.

CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY
During the Paleolithic Era,
and until recently in fact,
a child would be breastfed
until he or she was three or
four years old, a necessity
preventing mothers
from joining long-distance hunting expeditions
without their toddlers.
However, a breastfeeding
woman could complete
tasks that “don’t require
rapt concentration, are relatively dull and repetitive;
they are easily interrupted, don’t place the child in
danger, and don’t require
the participant to stray far
from home.”22 Spinning,
weaving, and sewing were
some of these tasks. Also, the essential tasks of preparing food and clothing could be accomplished
with a nursing toddler nearby. These tasks that may be consigned as “women’s work” today are
among the most important tasks (and very time consuming ones before the industrial revolution)
that a human could perform. In fact, they were so time consuming that women would spend most
of their day on them, often being assisted by men.
Over time, Paleolithic women gathered new species of berries as well as bird eggs, and learned
which mushrooms were nontoxic. Women also were the principal gatherers of mosses for sleeping
mats and other plants for shelter. When men returned with a kill, the women then began an involved
process of dressing and butchering it. Sinews from animals and fibers from plants became rope to
tie or fasten the hides as well as baskets. Women thus were essential to any kind of productivity or
progress associated with hunting. Women used sinews and fibers to create netting for transport and
for hunting and fishing. In hunting societies with elements of horticulture, women were responsible for, and could provide, such food as legumes, eggs, and grains. Food gathering and weaving,
especially in the dry Mediterranean, was an outdoor and community activity that also served as a
preschool and apprentice system for children. So women were also community educators.
Neolithic Women
While Paleolithic women certainly had important responsibilities, the added tasks of herding
and animal domestication expanded their roles tremendously in the Neolithic era. Neolithic

survival required not only effective food storage, but also increased production. Children on a
farm can be more helpful and put in less danger than those on a hunt. Neolithic women increasingly bore more children, either because of increased food production or to help augment it. This
increase in child bearing may also have offset an increase in mortality due, for example, to disease.
Because dangers from disease grew in new villages due to the ease with which deadly diseases
spread in close quarters, and nearby domesticated animals whose diseases spread from animal to
humans, more children would be necessary to replace those who had succumbed to illness.
While Neolithic women carried an increased child-bearing responsibility, their other responsibilities did not necessarily wane. Though women may not have fired pottery when it began to
appear some 6,000 years ago, they appeared on it in decorative symbols of female fertility. Around
4,000 BCE, gendered tasks shifted again with the domestication of draft animals. Food production once again became men’s domain, as herding was incompatible with childrearing. Later, in
Neolithic herding societies, women were often responsible for the actual domestication of feral
babies, nursing them and raising them. Men would shear sheep, help weave, market the textiles,
and cultivate the food that was prepared in the home.
We should say that this was not the case with all agricultural societies, as many horticulturalists who were able to cultivate crops closer to home were able to remain matrilineal. For example,
we have the case of Minoan women on the Mediterranean island of Crete that we discuss in more
detail in Chapter Five. On Crete’s hilly terrain, women were able to cultivate terraced horticulture and keep herds of sheep and goats nearby. Therefore, as women lost power and influence
elsewhere due to more intensive agriculture, Minoan women actually expanded their control over
Crete’s economic and cultural life and would help give rise to Classical Greece.
1.6.4 Toward First Civilizations
We will discuss the Bronze Age elsewhere, but we should mention here that new pursuits like
mining added to the domestic burden on women. The advent of the Bronze Age led to far-spread
searching and mining for copper and other metals like arsenic or tin to harden it and create the
bronze alloy. Mining consequently become a male pursuit. Between 9,000 and 4,000 BCE, as
metal become a source for wealth and subsistence, men’s roles shifted from being secondary to
being both the food collectors and the economic backbone of individual families and societies.
These Neolithic developments in sedentary agriculture and village life would be the foundation
for an explosion of cultural development three thousand years later in Egypt and Mesopotamia
(addressed later in this text). By the Age of Exploration in the 1500s CE, most of the world had
adopted agriculture as a primary means of subsistence, and the foundation of great civilizations.
1.7 SUMMARY
The story of world civilizations really begins six to eight million years ago when ancestors of
modern humans began to walk upright. Millions of years of evolutionary response to changing
climates and environment led to the existence of our species, Homo sapiens. While other 
Page | 19
CHAPTER 1: PREHISTORY
hominids migrated out of Africa, had language, and made fire and tools, it was Homo sapiens
who were able to navigate open oceans and eventually populate the entire planet. Over the last
50,000 years or so, Homo sapiens became modern humans by improving their hunting, their
building techniques, their community living, and their food gathering and storage. About 10,000
years ago, the Neolithic Era began. Humans began to live in larger, permanent settlements where
a permanent food source needed to be nearby. These were the beginnings of agriculture. This
“agricultural revolution” deeply affected gender relationships, class distinctions, and economic
priorities as most humans left their foraging days behind them, the importance of which will be
discussed in later chapters.

The term civilization often elicits mostly idealized images of ancient empires, monumental
architecture, and the luxurious lives of ruling classes. Civilization, however, is a tricky term. In
the United States, students of history studied Western Civilization, almost exclusively, through
the 1950s. In their studies, civilizations were advanced societies with urban centers, rooted in
European or Middle Eastern culture. America’s origins in these western civilizations was used
to explain our own high level of development. However, more recent scholars have definitely
broadened the geographical focus by recognizing that worldwide from 3500 to 1000 BCE at least
seven independent civilizations emerged in different regions. These recent scholars also continue
to debate the definition of civilization, and the current compromise amongst World Historians
is to recognize characteristics that civilizations tended to share. Common characteristics of
civilizations included food surpluses, higher population densities, social stratification, systems of
taxation, labor specialization, regular trade, and accumulated learning (or knowledge passed down
from generation to generation). The list here is not all-inclusive by any means, but it indicates the
complexity of the societies that scholars have labeled civilizations.
In addition to heated debates about its exact definition, civilization is a loaded term, meaning
that it can contain a value judgment. If we use the term carelessly, it seems to indicate that some
societies are deemed civilized and worthy of inclusion, while others are uncivilized and thus
not worth our study. In part, our sensitivity to this issue is a response to the tendency of past
historians, including many of those working in Europe in the 1800s, to assume that there was a 
Page | 23
CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
natural progression from an uncivilized state to civilization. These historians viewed people who
had values, ways of living, and religious beliefs different than theirs as uncivilized. They further
believed that these allegedly uncivilized peoples were behind or needed to catch up with those who
were civilized. Today, World Historians try to appreciate the great diversity of human experiences
and consciously remove these sorts of value judgments. World Historians avoid assumptions
that some societies in the past were better or further along than others. Therefore, many World
Historians remain wary of the uncritical use of the term civilization.
For our purposes, let us leave aside any value judgments. Societies labeled as civilizations
were not inherently better than any others. In fact, as we will see, civilizations demonstrated
various vulnerabilities. Considering things like war, slavery, and the spread of diseases, there
were sometimes advantages to living outside the nexus of civilizations. For example, in comparing
societies, scholars have found that in many instances people residing in decentralized states were
healthier and lived longer than did their counterparts in early civilizations. However, people
living in societies with social stratification, labor specialization, and trade usually left more
written records and archeological evidence, which historians can analyze to narrate our past. The
available resources mean that civilizations tend to be better represented in the written historical
records. As you read about past civilizations, keep in mind that historians are currently enhancing
our understanding of societies that perhaps remained mobile, rejected hierarchies, or preserved
their histories orally. These societies were also part of our shared past, even if they are harder to
study or have received less scholarly attention.
This chapter focuses on early civilizations in the Fertile Crescent and Northeast Africa.
The civilizations in these regions left written records. They also all initially had economies based
on farming and developed alongside rivers. Their locations alongside rivers allowed populations
in the Fertile Crescent and Northeast Africa to grow the surplus food that they used to support
urbanization, social stratification, labor specialization, and trade.

2.5 ANCIENT MESOPOTAMIA
Mesopotamia is located in an area known as the Fertile Crescent. Archeologists have found some
of the earliest known sites of agricultural production in the Fertile Crescent. Although much of this
region received little or irregular rainfall, the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers provided large amounts
of freshwater, facilitating agricultural production and the development of early civilizations. The
Greeks later recognized the significance of the river systems to these ancient societies and referred
to the region as “the Land between the
Rivers” or Mesopotamia.
The Tigris and Euphrates Rivers
both originate in the Taurus Mountains
of eastern Anatolia and flow southward
to empty into the Persian Gulf. The
rivers carry and deposit silt downstream,
enriching the soil. In general, the richer
soils and availability of water in areas that
in the north otherwise had little rain, or
else towards the south had concentrated
months of rainfall followed by long, dry
spells, encouraged settlement near the
rivers. The areas closer to the Persian
Gulf, known as Lower Mesopotamia,
in particular, were attractive to early
settlers because they had extremely
fertile soils. People built some of the
earliest cities, including Uruk, Eridu,
and Ur, in Lower Mesopotamia.
While the Tigris and Euphrates
Rivers did provide water to the region,
their floods were unpredictable and could
even be catastrophic when they washed
away entire settlements. In response, the 
Page | 26
region’s residents created irrigation canals and drainage ditches to control the flow of water. They
also stored water in reservoirs to use during the dry months of the year. Additionally, in parts of
Lower Mesopotamia, the courses of the rivers and their tributaries changed frequently, so people
either had to move to follow the water’s new path or divert a river to continue supplying water
for their settlement. As regular access to water supported agricultural surpluses and population
growth, people tended to fare better against the unpredictability of the floods, seasonal changes,
and the rivers’ changing courses when they lived in settlements capable of maintaining irrigation
canals, drainage ditches, and water reservoirs.
The rivers offered
another benefit to ancient
Mesopotamians. Just as
the rivers were definitely
important to meet people’s
everyday needs for water and
for agricultural production,
so they also facilitated trade.
While people made use of
local resources, like mud to
build their homes, in general,
Lower Mesopotamia lacked
other desired resources,
including wood, stone, and
precious metals. Traders
were able to use the rivers
to bring in these resources
from Assyria, Anatolia, the
Levant, and areas adjacent
to the Persian Gulf. Early
Mesopotamians also obtained
goods from as far away as what today are northern Pakistan and India. Merchants used overland
routes that crossed the Iranian Plateau and sea routes, exchanging Mesopotamian products like
grains and textiles for luxury goods from the east. Royal cemeteries show that by 2500 BCE
Mesopotamian elites were buried with a variety of imports, including beads brought from the
Indus River Valley. The rivers and the overland trade routes also facilitated communication and,
with it, the sharing of ideas and technologies.
2.6 SUMERIAN CITY-STATES
Lower Mesopotamia, or the southern areas of Mesopotamia towards the Persian Gulf,
drew settlers, who moved to take advantage of rich soils and the availability of water in the
area commonly known as Sumer. The people who lived in Sumer are generally referred to as

connected with traders to the east by crossing the Iranian Plateau.

CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
Sumerians. Prior to 3,000 BCE, Sumerians, whose origins remain a subject of debate, founded a
number of independent cities in Lower Mesopotamia. In these cities, Sumerians had organized
religions, centralized governments, social hierarchies, and access to trade networks. As these
cities expanded, their leaders claimed control over adjacent territories, forming at least a dozen
city-states, which became the basic organizational structure of Sumerian civilization in the third
millennium BCE. By incorporating the surrounding territories into city-states, urban centers were
able to draw on more resources.
Sumerian cities had certain characteristics in common. First, a temple complex or a ziggurat
was usually the visual focus of the urban landscape. Sumerians believed that their entire city
belonged to its main deity, and built a massive temple, the most important building in the city, to
be the dwelling place of their city’s main god or goddess. A complex that comfortably housed many
of the priests and priestesses who served the city’s deity surrounded each temple. In addition to
attending to the religious needs of the community, temples complexes also owned land, managed
industries, were involved in trade, and acted as banks. Their wide-ranging roles meant that temples
often had additional outbuildings, like granaries and storage sheds, in the surrounding countryside.
Sumerians were polytheistic, meaning they worshipped multiple gods and goddesses. Because
Sumerians believed each god had a family, they also built smaller shrines and temples dedicated
to these divine family members. Therefore, each city would have a number of temples while many
Sumerian homes had small altars dedicated to other gods. Sometimes, urban temples or ritual
spaces were built atop a ziggurat, a solid rectangular tower made of sun-dried mud bricks.
Archaeological evidence shows that
temple complexes were expanded and
rebuilt over time and, by the late third
millennium BCE, temples in many of
the Sumerian city-states were raised on
platforms or else situated on a ziggurat.
The towering architecture of the ziggurat
stressed the significance of the temple to
the surrounding community. The bestpreserved ziggurat, the Great Ziggurat of
Ur, was constructed with an estimated
720,000 baked bricks and rose to a
height of about 100 feet. The people of
Ur constructed this ziggurat for their
patron deity, the moon goddess Nanna.
They likely brought regular offerings to
Nanna and also received food rations
from the Great Ziggurat of Ur.
Viewing nature as unpredictable,
people brought offerings to their city’s
temple complexes or ziggurat, hoping to
Figure 2.1 | The Great Ziggurat of Ur | Located in what is
today the Dhi Qar Province of Iraq, Sumerians originally built
the ziggurat in the Third Dynasty of Ur (c. 2100 BCE). It has
been restored several times since, including fairly recently in
the 1980s.

please the gods who controlled the natural forces of their world. Priests and priestesses collected
and redistributed the offerings, demonstrating the vital roles they played in Sumerian society.
The relatively privileged position of priests and priestesses at the temple complex also shows
Sumerian social stratification (the development of a hierarchy) and how agricultural surpluses
supported the specialization of labor. Some of the early leaders of Sumerian cities may have been
“priest-kings,” who attained elevated positions through their association with the temples. The
later rulers of city-states definitely supported the temples, claiming to be acting on behalf of the
gods who brought divine favor to their followers.
Sumerian city-states had local rulers, who lived in large palaces, but most of these local rulers
were not considered kings. So far, archeologists have dated the earliest known royal palaces to
c. 2600 BCE and conclude that Sumerian city-states had centralized governments with secular
rulers by at least that timeframe. While there does seem
to have been a sense of inhabiting a shared space in
Southern Mesopotamia, referred to as “the Land” in written
records, city-states had distinctive identities. In part, their
distinctive identities revolved around their main deity.
The rulers of city-states alternately supported, competed
with, and fought against one another. The Sumerian
King List (Figure 2.2), a manuscript that listed early kings
and described their reigns (with some presumably fictive
and exaggerated elements), provides evidence of these
alliances, competition, and war. For example, it describes
En-mebarages as the second to last king of the 1st Dynasty of
Kish, “…who carried away as spoil the weapons of the land of
Elam, became king, and reigned 900 years…”1
 Local rulers
often came to power after proving themselves militarily.
Furthermore, the Sumerian King List recognized only
rulers who had established control over multiple city-states
as kings (with the title of lugal in the Sumerian language)
belonging to distinct dynasties. While it lasted, a dynasty
generally passed down the kingship through the male line.
According to the Sumerian King List, the seat of power, held
by hereditary kings, shifted from city-state to city-state with
the rise and fall of dynasties through the third millennium
BCE. Significantly, the Sumerian King List began its
recorded history “when kingship came down from heaven,”
legitimizing secular kings through their association with
gods.2
 Sumerian kings, often along with more local rulers, led armies, collected taxes, organized
labor for state projects, and meted out justice. At the top of the hierarchy and with control over

CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
multiple city-states, kings expected obedience from local rulers and their subjects, and support
from the priests and priestesses of the temples.
Kings, local rulers, priests, and priestesses held influential positions in Sumerian societies.
However, farmers, taken as a whole, made up an estimated 90% of the population. Other skilled
people included animal-breeders, merchants, craftspeople, fishermen, doctors, soldiers, architects,
and scribes. Surplus agricultural production collected as tribute as well as wealth generated by
trade supported such labor specialization. One important outcome of labor specialization was
innovation in metalworking. In approximately 2900 BCE, metalworkers began producing bronze,
which was stronger than copper. Stronger weapons and farming tools gave Sumerians advantages
when it came to combat and agricultural production.
Social stratification is further evident as some Sumerians and even institutions, including
temples, owned slaves. Slaves performed a variety of tasks like construction, weaving, agricultural
and domestic labor, tending animals, and even administrative work as scribes. Some slaves were
chattel slaves, meaning that society treated them as property with no rights. Usually, chattel slaves
were prisoners of war or slaves bought from outside communities. They were branded by barbers or
tattoo artists and forced to work at the will of their masters. If they tried to run away, the law required
slaves to be returned. The more widespread type of servitude in most Sumerians societies was likely
debt slavery, which was generally temporary until a debtor paid off a loan and its interest. Over the
past century or so, archaeologists have added a great deal to our understanding of Sumerian social
distinctions through their work at
numerous excavation sites, but many
gaps in our knowledge still exist.
The archaeological discovery of
cuneiform tablets at these excavation
sites has aided efforts to learn
about this civilization. Sumerians
developed cuneiform, a written
script of wedge shaped marks, around
3200 BCE. Cuneiform was one of the
earliest, if not the very first, written
script in the world. The Sumerian
King List, discussed above, was
recorded in cuneiform. Merchants,
scribes, administrators, priests,
and others kept written records
describing financial transactions,
court proceedings, administrative
decisions, and architectural plans.
They also wrote legends, epic poems, chants, and prayers. Most people were not literate, so
scribes—who had been specially trained in scribal schools—generated many of the records. While
in school, in addition to copying written passages, scribes learned arithmetic. The Sumerians

system of arithmetic was based on the number 60, which we still use to divide time into hours,
minutes, and seconds. Scribes used styluses made of reed to write on clay tablets that were dried
and could be stored. The discovery of cuneiform tablets has greatly aided archaeologists, but only
a small percentage of the tablets found to date have been translated.
Using archaeological and written evidence, scholars have pieced together what they can about
everyday life for Sumerians, though some questions remain. For instance, it has been a challenge
to determine the layout of urban spaces beyond the prominence of the temples and the relative
grandeur of palaces. From archaeological finds, scholars suspect that Sumerian cities were divided
into neighborhoods by occupation and according to kinship groups, but uncertainties about
specifics linger. Legal documents and tax records show that people owned property in both the
cities and the countryside. Also, evidence suggests social stratification, as some Sumerians owned
fairly large chunks of land, while others had much smaller plots or presumably no land at all. Wills,
court proceedings, and temple documents show that land and temple offices were usually bought
or else acquired through military or other service to the state. A man inherited land, property,
offices, and their attendant obligations to the state (like reoccurring military service) from his
father. The eldest son seems to have frequently inherited a larger share than younger brothers
and have been given control over the family home. He was tasked with performing regular rituals
to honor dead ancestors, who were usually buried underneath the home. From the written
documents, we also get glimpses into other aspects of Sumerian life, like marriage and divorce.
Sumerians viewed marriage as a contract between two families and, as a result, the male heads
of the two families arranged a couple’s marriage. Documents show that both families contributed
resources to seal the union or complete the marriage contract. The man’s family gave gifts or
money and hosted a feast, while the woman’s family amassed a dowry. Although a woman did
not automatically receive an inheritance upon the death of her father, she could expect (and use
the court system to make sure she got) to receive a dowry, even if it came from her father’s estate
after his death. Divorce was possible but sometimes led to social ostracism or even punishment
if there were accusations of misconduct, such consequences being especially the case for the
woman. Records indicate that polygamy was not common, but wealthier men did keep slave-girls
as concubines. Overall, Sumerians considered marriage an essential institution in that it brought
families together and ensured the continuation of the family lineage.
Legends, myths, poems, and literary texts tell us about Sumerians, too. For example, we
can explore their values and views of the afterlife through reading the Epic of Gilgamesh. The
Epic of Gilgamesh relates the adventures of Gilgamesh, a legendary king, who may have lived
around 2700 BCE. The epic has multiple versions and was told orally before it was first written
down in cuneiform in about 2000 BCE. The epic follows the heroic exploits of Gilgamesh and his
companion, Enkidu, to emphasize the importance of values such as loyalty and humility. In one
section, the epic describes a very gloomy afterlife where “people see no light, they sit in darkness,”3
reflecting Mesopotamian beliefs that the afterlife was miserable for all, even those who had lived
virtuously. Additionally, it portrays the environment as potentially violent and hostile as in its

flood story, which in some ways resembles the
account of Noah and the flood found in Genesis.
Ultimately, Gilgamesh fails at his quest to find
eternal life but learns to work for the glory of the
gods and for worthwhile human achievements.
Other archaeological finds and the written
documents also give some hint of the wider
popular culture and artistic conventions in
ancient Mesopotamia. For example, cuneiform
tablets with pictures of dancers and singers, as
well as instruments found in graves, suggest
that Sumerians placed importance on music,
using it for entertainment and ritual purposes.
Trying to learn more about Sumerian music,
scholars and other enthusiasts have replicated
these instruments and presented their best
estimation of Sumerian scales and tuning. The
documentary evidence suggests that hymns
from the ancient Sumerian city-states were
shared with later Mesopotamian empires and
even spread into the Mediterranean world.
2.7 MESOPOTAMIAN EMPIRES
In the second half of the third millennium BCE, Sumerian city-states fought each other, and
dynasties rose and fell. Kings consolidated power over multiple city-states in the region. Then, King
Sargon of Akkad enlarged the scale by conquering the Sumerian city-states and parts of Syria, Anatolia,
and Elam. In doing so, he created one of the world’s first empires in approximately 2334 BCE. For
generations, Mesopotamian literature celebrated the Akkadian Empire (c. 2334 – 2100 BCE) that
King Sargon founded. Like the Akkadian Empire, three subsequent empires, the Babylonian Empire
(c. 1792 – 1595 BCE), the Assyrian Empire (c. 900 – 612 BCE), and the Neo-Babylonian Empire (c.
605 – 539 BCE), also ruled large parts of Mesopotamia and the Fertile Crescent.
2.7.1 The Akkadian Empire (c. 2334 – 2100 BCE)
Sargon of Akkad founded the first empire in Mesopotamia. Legends about Sargon of Akkad
stress that he rose from obscurity to become a famous, powerful king. While the legends all tend
to describe him as coming from humble origins and rising to the top using his own wits, there
are many variations. One much later Babylonian tablet, from the seventh century BCE, describes
his background as descendent of a high priestess and an anonymous father. His mother hid her
pregnancy and the birth of Sargon, secreting him away in a wicker basket on a river, where he was

BCE. The reconstructed instrument is held at the

rescued and then raised by Aqqi, a water-drawer. This version of the legend links Sargon with a
more elite family through his birth-mother, a high priestess, but also shows how he had to advance
himself up to king after being adopted by the rather more humble figure of a water-drawer.
From his allegedly humble origins, Sargon of Akkad conquered Sumerian city-states one by
one, creating an empire, or a large territory, encompassing numerous states, ruled by a single
authority. It’s quite possible that Sargon of Akkad’s predecessor, who claimed to rule over the large
region stretching from the Mediterranean Sea to the Persian Gulf, began the process of building
the empire, but Sargon is remembered for accomplishing the task. One of the reasons we attribute
the empire to him is his use of public monuments. He had statues, stellae (tall, upright pillars),
and other monuments built throughout his realm to celebrate his military victories and to build a
sense of unity within his empire. Archaeologists have not found the empire’s capital city, Akkad.
However, from the available information, archaeologists have estimated its location, placing it to
the north of the early Mesopotamian city-states, including Ur and Sumer. It is clear that Sargon of
Akkad turned the empire’s capital at Akkad into one of the wealthiest and most powerful cities in the
world. According to documentary sources, the city’s splendor stood as another symbol of Sargon’s
greatness. The city grew into a cosmopolitan center especially because of its role in trade. Akkadian
rulers seized and taxed trade goods, with trade routes extending as far as India. Sargon ruled the
empire for over fifty years. His sons, grandson, and great grandson attempted to hold the empire

together. After about 200 years, attacks from neighboring peoples caused the empire to fall. After
the fall of the Akkadian Empire, Hammurabi founded the next empire in the region in 1792 BCE.
2.7.2 The Babylonian Empire (1792 – 1595 BCE)
Hammurabi, who aspired to follow Sargon’s example, created the next empire in the region, the
Babylonian Empire. With well-disciplined foot soldiers armed with copper and bronze weapons,
he conquered Mesopotamian city-states, including Akkad and Sumer, to create an empire with its
capital at Babylon. Although he had other achievements, Hammurabi is most famous for the law
code etched into a stele that bears his name, the Stele of Hammurabi.
The Stele of Hammurabi records a comprehensive set of laws. Codes of law existed prior to
Hammurabi’s famous stele, but Hammurabi’s Code gets a lot of attention because it is still
intact and has proven very influential. As seen in Figure 2.5, the upper part of the stele depicts
Hammurabi standing in front of the Babylonian
god of justice, from whom Hammurabi derives
his power and legitimacy. The lower portion of
the stele contains the collection of 282 laws. One
particularly influential principle in the code is
the law of retaliation, which demands “an eye
for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.” The code listed
offenses and their punishments, which often
varied by social class. While symbolizing the
power of the King Hammurabi and associating
him with justice, the code of law also attempted
to unify people within the empire and establish
common standards for acceptable behavior. An
excerpt of Hammurabi’s Code appears below:
6. If anyone steal the property of a temple
or of the court, he shall be put to death,
and also the one who receives the stolen
thing from him shall be put to death.
8. If any one steal cattle or sheep, or
an ass, or a pig or a goat, if it belong to
a god or to the court, the thief shall pay
thirtyfold therefore; if they belonged to a
freed man of the king he shall pay tenfold;
if the thief has nothing with which to pay
he shall be put to death.

15. If any one receive into his house a runaway male or female slave of the court, or of a
freedman, and does not bring it out at the public proclamation of the major domus, the
master of the house shall be put to death.
53. If any one be too lazy to keep his dam in proper condition, and does not so keep it;
if then the dam break and all the fields be flooded, then shall he in whose dam the break
occurred be sold for money, and the money shall replace the corn which he has caused to
be ruined.
108. If a tavern-keeper (feminine) does not accept corn according to gross weight in
payment of drink, but takes money, and the price of the drink is less than that of the corn,
she shall be convicted and thrown into the water.
110. If a “sister of god” open a tavern, or enter a tavern to drink, then shall this woman be
burned to death.
127. If any one “point the finger” (slander) at a sister of a god or the wife of any one, and
can not prove it, this man shall be taken before the judges and his brow shall be marked.
(by cutting the skin or perhaps hair)
129. If a man’s wife be surprised (in flagrante delicto) with another man, both shall be tied
and thrown into the water, but the husband may pardon his wife and the king his slaves.
137. If a man wish to separate from a woman who has borne him children, or from his
wife who has borne him children: then he shall give that wife her dowry, and a part of the
usufruct of field, garden, and property, so that she can rear her children. When she has
brought up her children, a portion of all that is given to the children, equal as that of one
son, shall be given to her. She may then marry the man of her heart.
195. If a son strike his father, his hands shall be hewn off.
196. If a man put out the eye of another man his eye shall be put out. (An eye for an eye)
197. If he break another man’s bone, his bone shall be broken.

Hammurabi also improved infrastructure, promoted trade, employed effective administrative
practices, and supported productive agriculture. For example, he sponsored the building of roads
and the creation of a postal service. He also maintained irrigation canals and facilitated trade
all along the Persian Gulf. After Hammurabi’s death, his successors lost territory. The empire
declined, shrinking in size. The Hittites, from Anatolia, eventually sacked the city of Babylon in
1595 BCE, bringing about the official end of the Babylonian Empire.
2.7.3 The Assyrian Empire (c. 900 – 612 BCE)
The Assyrian Empire, which saw its height of power at the end of the first millennium to the
seventh century BCE, was larger than any empire that preceded it.
Dominating the region, its well-equipped soldiers used their stronger iron weapons to extend
the empire’s control through Mesopotamia, Syria, parts of Anatolia, Palestine, and up the Nile
into Egypt. They used siege warfare, along with battering rams, tunnels, and moveable towers, to
get past the defenses of cities. The Assyrians had a large army (with perhaps as many as 150,000
soldiers) that utilized a core of infantry, a cavalry, as well as chariots. As part of their military
strategy, the Assyrians purposefully tried to inspire fear in their enemies; they decapitated
conquered kings, burnt cities to the ground, destroyed crops, and dismembered defeated enemy
soldiers. One Assyrian soldier claimed:
In strife and conflict I besieged [and] conquered the city. I felled 3,000 of their fighting
men with the sword…I captured many troops alive: I cut off of some of their arms [and]
hands; I cut off of others their noses, ears, [and] extremities. I gouged out the eyes of many
troops. I made one pile of the living [and] one of heads. I hung their heads on trees around
the city.5
The Assyrians expected these methods to deter potential rebellions and used their spoils of
war, like precious metals and livestock, to finance further military campaigns. After conquering
an area, they conscripted men into their army, and employed resettlement and deportation as
techniques to get laborers where they wanted them and deal with communities who opposed

their regime. They also collected annual tributes that were apparently high enough to, at least
occasionally, spur rebellions despite the Assyrians’ reputation for violent retribution.
In addition to its military strength, the Assyrian empire also stands out for the size of its cities and
its administrative developments. The empire’s biggest cities, such as Nineveh and Assur, each had
several million people living within them. Administratively, kings ruled Assyria, appointing governors
to oversee provinces and delegates to keep tabs on the leaders of allied states. There were between
100 and 150 governors, delegates, and top officials entrusted by the king with ruling in his place and
helping him maintain the empire. In the later centuries of the Assyrian Empire, kings chose these
officials on the basis of merit and loyalty. Kings met with large groups of officials for rituals, festivals,
and military campaigns. Evidence of such meetings has led some scholars to propose the possibility
that the king and his officials might have worked together in something resembling a parliamentary
system, though there is no scholarly consensus on the point. Ultimately, the Assyrian Empire became
too large to control; rebellions occurred with more frequency and were difficult for its overextended
military to quell. The empire fell after the conquest of Nineveh in 612 BCE.

2.7.4 The New Babylonian Empire (c. 626 – 539 BCE)
With the weakening of the Assyrian Empire, the New Babylonian Empire began to dominate
Mesopotamia. Lasting for less than 100 years, the New Babylonian Empire is best known for
its ruler, Nebuchadnezzar II, and its great architectural projects. As described in the Hebrew
Scriptures (also known as the Old Testament), Nebuchadnezzar II, who ruled from 605 – 562
BCE, was a ruthless leader. He gained notoriety for destroying the city of Jerusalem and deporting
many of the city’s Jews to Babylon. The captive Jews suffered in exile, as they were not allowed
to return to their homeland. Nebuchadnezzar II also rebuilt Babylon with fortresses, temples,
and enormous palaces. He associated the New Babylonian Empire with the glory of ancient
Babylonia by reviving elements of Sumerian and Akkadian culture. For example, he had artists
restore ancient artwork and celebrated the kings of old, like Hammurabi. Nebuchadnezzar is often
also credited with rebuilding the city’s ziggurat, Etemanaki, or the “Temple of the Foundation of
Heaven and Earth.” When completed, the ziggurat rose several stories above the city and seemed
to reach to the heavens. Some scholars claim that the Babylonian ziggurat was the famous Tower
of Babel described in the Old Testament. Another one of Nebuchadnezzar’s purported projects,
the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, was considered by the later Greek historian Herodotus to be
one of the Seven Wonders of the World. According to legend, Nebuchadnezzar had the hanging
gardens built for his wife. He made the desert bloom to remind her of her distant homeland;
the elaborate gardens planted on rooftops and terraces were designed so that the plants’ leaves
would spill down high walls. Since definitive archaeological evidence of the Hanging Gardens
of Babylon has not been found, scholars continue to debate its most likely location and even
its very existence. After the death of Nebuchadnezzar II, outside military pressures as well as
internal conflict weakened the empire until the much larger Persian Empire conquered the New
Babylonian Empire in 539 BCE.
2.8 THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MESOPOTAMIA FOR WORLD HISTORY
Mesopotamia saw the emergence of some of the first cities and the world’s first empires. The
city-states of the region flourished from about 3000 to 2300 BCE. Then, Sargon of Akkad and
subsequent rulers built empires, expanding their control and influence over even larger territories.
There were cultural links and commonalities found in the Sumerian city-states of the third
millennium BCE. With agricultural production dependent on access to water, cities initially grew in
Southern Mesopotamia near rivers, namely the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers and their tributaries.
Sumerians tried to control their environment using irrigation, drainage ditches, water reserves, and
other methods. With unpredictable floods and other environmental challenges, the Sumerians viewed
nature as hostile and their expectations of the afterlife tended to be pessimistic. Their understanding
of nature as unpredictable also spurred engineering innovations as Sumerians prepared for floods,
water shortages, and other natural events. While farming was the mainstay of their economies,
city-states were also involved in robust long-distance trade networks, which allowed them to garner
the many resources not available in their region. These city-states alternately allied with, competed 
Page | 38
against, and waged war on one another, with kingship emerging as rulers dominated multiple citystates. As evidenced by the centrality of temples and the belief that kingship came from heaven,
religion was of fundamental importance to these societies. Archaeologists have also uncovered ample
evidence of social stratification and labor specialization in these ancient city-states. Archeologists
have been able to recognize Sumerian developments, in part, because the Sumerians left behind a
wealth of information documented in cuneiform, one of the world’s first written scripts. Scholars
have begun to describe life in ancient Sumerian societies and appreciate the many Sumerian
achievements, like those in math, where they introduced a computation system based on 60 (which
we still use to divide time and in geometry as a circle has 360°). Overall, Sumerians were innovators,
with some of the first cities, one of the first systems of writing, notable achievements in engineering
and architecture, the creation of larger political entities, and more.
Starting with the Akkadian Empire, four empires controlled vast territories in Mesopotamia
and the Fertile Crescent. Over a period of almost 1800 years, these empires brought together
diverse communities, often by military conquest and force. The empires facilitated trade, and
spread ideas and culture. Their rulers developed administrative, military, and other techniques to
try to ensure compliance and recognition of their authority. As intended, the rulers and the cities
they built live on in legends, even though their empires eventually withered and fell.
2.9 THE ISRAELITES AND ANCIENT ISRAEL
The Israelites, “or children of Israel,” were Semetic-speakers who lived in Canaan and traced
their descent back to Abraham through his grandson Israel. Hebrew tradition begins their
history with Abraham’s departure from Ur in southern Mesopotamia (see Map 2.1). Therefore,
Abraham is important in Jewish tradition, as he has been recognized as the first Jew, the
patriarch from whom all Jews trace their descent, and a role model. As described in the Hebrew
Scriptures, known to Christians as the Old Testament, Abraham also made a covenant with God,
which blessed his descendants. Jews, Christians, and Muslims of today all recognize Abraham
as a significant figure, though these major monotheistic religions view him a little differently.
Respect for Abraham by believers in all three of these religions is just one indication that the
world’s three major monotheistic religions are connected. Examining these connections reveals
the extraordinary contributions that the Israelites made to World History. The Israelites were
highly influential in developing the idea of monotheism, or belief in one god. Furthermore,
they recorded their history orally at first, until their tradition was written down in the Hebrew
Scriptures (alternatively referred to as the Tanakh, the Hebrew Bible, or the Old Testament of the
Christian Bible). The Hebrew Scriptures has been one of the most important texts ever written.
Eventually, by the end of the second millennium BCE (likely between 1200 and 1000 BCE),
the Israelites established small kingdoms in the Levant. The Levant refers to areas adjacent to
the eastern Mediterranean; in the ancient world, it comprised roughly the area from southern
Anatolia through coastal areas of the eastern Mediterranean south and westward to the Egyptian
delta. The Israelite kingdoms were concentrated along the Mediterranean coast in what are today
Israel and the contested territory of the West Bank/Palestine. 
Page | 39
CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
Much debate exists amongst scholars about the sources used to reconstruct the history of the
Israelites with much of the debate revolving around the use and interpretation of religious texts,
particularly the Hebrew Scriptures. Right now, scholars rely fairly heavily on the Hebrew Scriptures
to discuss periods before about 1200 BCE because other sources just do not exist. Some main points
of contention have centered on dates, the purpose of religious texts, the reality that the Hebrew
Scriptures were written centuries after the events they described, and the relationship between the
scriptures and historical fact. Additionally, there has been back and forth discussion about whether
archaeological finds confirm or disprove the narrative in the religious texts. These heated debates have
led some scholars to question whether it is even possible to write a history of the ancient Israelites.
For our purposes, this section will give an overview of Hebrew tradition and, using archaeological
and collaborating evidence when possible, describe the development of the Israelite civilization.
2.10 EARLY ISRAELITES
By leading people out of Ur, his homeland in Southern Mesopotamia, to eventually settle in
Canaan, later called Palestine, Abraham began the traditional history of the Israelites. According
to Hebrew tradition, even before leaving Ur, Abraham taught his followers about the existence of a
single, creator god and rejected the idol-worship and sin of Ur. The narrative continues to explain
how when Abraham agreed to God’s directive to leave his homeland, God blessed him and all of his
descendants. God entered into a covenant with Abraham, saying, “…And I will make you into a
great nation, and I will bless you, and I will make your name great…and by you all the families of the
earth shall bless themselves.”6
 Jews recognize this covenant as indicating their special relationship
with God, and it remains one of the most important aspects of the Jewish faith.
Tradition recounts how several generations later Abraham’s grandson, Israel (also called
Jacob), had twelve sons, who became the ancestors of the Twelve Tribes of Israel. One of these
twelve sons, Joseph, led followers from Canaan during a famine to settle in Egypt. As the biblical
text describes, the Israelites were prosperous at first and were becoming powerful, leading the
Egyptian pharaoh to fear their influence. To try to stem the Israelite influence, the pharaoh put
restrictions on births and forced them into slave labor. Then, Moses, whose mother had secreted
him away in a waterproof basket on the Nile River, played an important role in delivering his
people from subjugation. According to Hebrew tradition, God tasked Moses with leading his
people out of Egypt, a flight to freedom called Exodus. Moses led “the children of Israel” into
Sinai, where they entered into the Sinai Covenant. This covenant bound all Israelites into a pact
with God. Israelites agreed to worship God alone and obey his law, while God confirmed the
place of the Israelites as his “Chosen People,” whom he would protect. As part of the covenant,
Israelites agreed to follow the Ten Commandments. According to Hebrew tradition, God gave
the Ten Commandments to the Israelites at Mount Sinai, instructing the Israelites to worship only
him, keep the Sabbath, and honor their parents. The Ten Commandments also prohibit idolatry,
blasphemy, murder, adultery, theft, dishonesty, and coveting.
6 As quoted in “Abraham and the Covenant,” Israel and Judaism Studies. http://www.ijs.org.au/Abraham-and-the-Covenant/default.aspx
Page | 40
These written traditions established important elements of the Jewish faith. For example,
the Hebrew Scriptures trace Jewish descent from the Hebrew patriarchs: Abraham, Isaac, Israel
(alternatively known as Jacob), and the twelve sons of Israel. They also describe the transition to
monotheism and the covenant relationship between God and “the children of Israel.” Israelites
believed in one god, Yahweh, who created and ruled over everything in the universe, and overall,
they perceived Yahweh as being just and merciful. The ideas that there is a single, universal god
and that his laws apply to everyone have been defining tenets of other monotheistic religions.
Subsequent written and oral traditions, like the Talmud, reflect further development of Jewish
beliefs, ethics, laws, and practice.
2.11 THE UNITED KINGDOM OF ISRAEL
After Exodus, the Israelites resettled in Canaan and in time began to unify. They formed
kingdoms in the Levant just prior to 1000 BCE. King Saul (c. 1030 – 1009 BCE), a member of
one of the Twelve Tribes of Israel, established the first Israelite monarchy, but ruled over a fairly
limited territory and died in battle with the Philistines. He was crowned king and began the
process of unification, but did not completely defeat his enemies and finish unification before he
died. His son, King David, (d. 969 BCE), is often portrayed as Israel’s greatest ruler or a model
king. He established the United Kingdom of Israel, with its capital at Jerusalem. King David’s
successor, his son Solomon, further shaped the kingdom.
In popular memory, King David is probably most remembered for defeating Goliath. Historical
traditions also celebrate him for expanding the borders of a newly unified Israel, contributing to
the Book of Psalms, and, in Christian tradition, for being a forbear of Jesus. David was a “warrior
king,” who defeated both internal and external enemies to unite Israel. He maintained a large
standing army that helped extend his influence and create neighboring tributary states. With
control of trade routes and tribute coming in from neighboring territories, Israel became a wealthy
state under David. With this wealth, David began to build Jerusalem into the capital city of the
Israelites, with further plans to build a temple to house the Ark of the Covenant (which according
to Hebrew tradition held the Ten Commandments). David died before building this temple, but
tradition credits him with other achievements, including composing many of the hymns and
prayers in the Book of Psalms. Like Abraham, David is considered an important figure by Jews,
Christians, and Muslims.
King Solomon, David’s son, ruled a mostly peaceful realm. He accomplished his father’s goal of
building the first Jewish temple in Jerusalem. The temple exemplified monumental architecture and
became a focal point for the Jews of Jerusalem. Its ruins, known as the Western Wall or the Wailing
Wall, are still a site of Jewish prayer and pilgrimage. Solomon also directed the building of a royal
palace, a defensive wall around the city of Jerusalem, and fortresses along the kingdom’s frontier.
Administratively, Solomon set up twelve districts, overseen by purveyors, who collected tribute
in kind (usually as crops or foodstuffs). Each of the twelve districts was charged with supplying
the king and the court for one month a year. Finally, Solomon used treaties and reciprocal trade
agreements to maintain relatively peaceful relationships with Israel’s neighbors. He also forged 
Page | 41
CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
diplomatic relations through marriage;
according to scripture, he had 700 wives!
After Solomon’s death, what had been
the United Kingdom of Israel split into
two pieces: Israel and Judah. Over the
long term, some of Solomon’s policies,
including forced labor and tributary
payments, likely contributed to the divide.
After the decline of the United Kingdom
of Israel, Hebrew tradition describes
the significance of great prophets or
teachers, who spoke on behalf of god
and set moral and ethical standards
for the whole community. Yahweh sent
these prophets to warn the Israelites that
they were not abiding by their covenant.
The prophets during this later period,
especially Jeremiah and Second Isaiah,
cultivated a new conceptualization of the
covenant, which was much more personal
as it was a relationship between Yahweh
and each individual.
The Assyrians and later the Greeks
and then the Romans brought parts of
the former United Kingdom of Israel
under their rule. These conquests
and persecution forced members of
the Jewish population into exile. This
conceptualization of being members of
a diaspora, that is, a scattered people
who desire to return to their homeland,
has played an important part in the
formation of a Jewish identity. Also, in part, due to this history, preservation of cultural and
religious heritage has become an enduring objective of Jews.
2.12 THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ISRAELITES AND ANCIENT ISRAEL
The Israelites left an extraordinary religious and ethical legacy. They were some of the first
monotheists, worshipping a single god, whom they referred to as Yahweh. Their religious texts
from the ancient world, including the Hebrew Scriptures, served as the foundational texts of
Judaism. The Hebrew Scriptures were also the basis of the Christian Old Testament, and Islam

recognizes parts of the scriptures as divine revelations. There were other, widespread religious
influences as well. For example, Christians and Muslims consider many of the figures, including
Abraham, Moses, and David, and teachings, like the Ten Commandments, from the Hebrew
Scriptures to be very important. Furthermore, the Hebrew Scriptures contained the idea that
everyone, regardless of status, was bound to obey the law.
The United Kingdom of Israel was a “golden age,” associated with the creation of a unified,
wealthy state with its new capital in Jerusalem. This civilization had well-developed religious
traditions, political power vested in a king, monumental architecture, and administrative
innovations. It also maintained a strong military, multiple tributary states, long-distance trade
networks, and well-established diplomatic relationships with foreign states.
2.13 ANCIENT EGYPT
In our study of World History, ancient Egypt serves as an excellent example of a complex
society with cross-cultural connections, adaption to and control over changing environments,
and sophisticated political and religious developments. All of these themes are evident in an
examination of the origins of Egypt. Egyptian leaders unified Upper and Lower Egypt around
3100 BCE, creating a powerful ancient state. Developments in the millennia preceding unification,
including the sharing of innovations and responses to environmental change, set the stage for the
emergence of the Egyptian civilization.
Cross-cultural connections introduced the people of Northeast Africa to domesticated wheat
and barley, two of the crops that they grew and whose surpluses supported the process of social
differentiation and eventually the pharaonic, elite, and skilled classes of ancient Egypt. People in
Northeast Africa had likely been gathering wild barley since before 10,000 BCE. However, sharing
in the knowledge spreading from the Fertile Crescent around 7,000 BCE, they began cultivating
wheat and barley and also keeping domesticated animals, including sheep and goats. At that time,
agricultural production and herding were possible in areas that are today part of the Sahara Desert.
The period was much wetter than now. People in the region settled into small communities, and
archaeological evidence of hearths, grinding stones, and storage silos show the growth of settlements
in areas that today are not well watered enough for agricultural production. The presence of crocodile
bones, along with similar pottery styles, also suggest a history of contact between communities
emerging along the Nile River and these settlements farther west. However, environmental change
was leading to the desiccation or drying out of areas not adjacent to the Nile River, and by about
5,000 BCE, it was no longer possible to farm much beyond the floodplain of the Nile River. Many
people adapted by moving towards the Nile River, and the Nile River became increasingly important
to Egypt’s populations.
The Nile River flows south to north, fed by two main river systems: the White Nile and
the Blue Nile. The White Nile flows steadily throughout the year and has its origins in the Great
Lakes Region of East Africa. The Blue Nile originates in the Ethiopian highlands, and brings
floodwaters up past the first cataract in the summers. (The first cataract lies roughly at Aswan on
the map in Map 2.6.) Cataracts are generally considered impassable by boat due to their shallows, 
Page | 43
CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
rocks, and rapids. Comparatively, the flood plain of the Nile River is narrow, leading, especially
with the desiccation of the surrounding areas, to high population densities close to the river.
The winds also blow north to south, in the opposite direction of the river flow, thus facilitating
trade and contact between Upper Egypt (to the south) and Lower Egypt (to the north). Upper and
Lower Egypt lie north of the first cataract, usually allowing river traffic to proceed uninterrupted
throughout the territory. Egyptian views of the Nile generally recognized the river’s centrality to
life as demonstrated in the “Hymn to the Nile,” dated
to approximately 2100 BCE. The praise-filled ode
to the Nile River begins, “Hail to thee, O Nile! Who
manifests thyself over this land, and comes to give
life to Egypt.”7
 The course of the Nile River definitely
impacted settlement patterns, while the river also
allowed for trade and the development of larger
agricultural communities.
At the tail end of that era of desiccation, from
about 3600 to 3300 BCE, complex societies formed in
areas adjacent to the Nile River. These communities
exerted increased influence over their environments,
exhibited social differentiation, and showed evidence
of labor specialization. For example, people in the
settlements of Naganda and Hierakonpolis in Upper
Egypt cleared trees and built dykes, canals, and
early irrigation systems. By about 3500 BCE, they
used these methods to quadruple the amount of
cleared, arable land and could support population
densities of up to one thousand people per square
mile. Just as one example, recent archaeological finds
at Hierakonpolis also show evidence of both social
differential and specialization with separate burials
for the settlement’s elite, the oldest known painted
tomb, and the remnants of a large-scale brewery,
capable of producing up to 300 gallons of beer a
day. It is believed that early leaders in Naganda,
Hierakonpolis, and similar communities cemented
their roles by claiming control over the environment
as rainmakers or commanders of the floods. Over time,
some of these leaders created divine kingships,
asserting their right to even more power and access
to resources, power that they legitimized by claiming

special relationships with, or even descent from, gods. Once Egypt was unified, pharaohs ruled as
divine kings, as the personification of the gods. They promised order in the universe. When things
went well, the pharaohs were credited with agricultural productivity and the success of the state.
There was no separation between religion and the state in ancient Egypt.
The Palette of Narmer (see Figure 2.6 and Figure 2.7), which is used to date the unification
of Egypt, shows signs that King Narmer legitimized his rule, in part, by claiming a special
relationship with the gods. King Narmer,
who is referred to in some text as Menes, is
commonly recognized as the first unifier of
Upper (to the south) and Lower (to the north)
Egypt in approximately 3100 BCE (see Map
2.7). Unification brought together Egypt from
the first cataract at Aswan to the Nile Delta.
The Palette of Narmer, which was found in
Hierakonpolis, shows King Narmer’s conquest
of both regions. The right side in Figure 2.6
shows him slaying an enemy of Upper Egypt.
The largest figure, Narmer is wearing the crown
of Upper Egypt and beheading a rival king, while
standing atop conquered enemies. The left side
also shows him as a conqueror, wearing the
crown of Lower Egypt and directing flag bearers
to mark his victory. Religious imagery appears
in the inclusion of the goddess Hathor at the top
of the palette as well as the falcon, a reference
to Horus, the patron god of Hierakonpolis, who
later in dynastic Egypt became the god of sun
and kingship.
Both sides of the Palette of Narmer also
have some of the earliest known hieroglyphs.
Hieroglyphics emerged as written text,
combining pictograms (a pictorial symbol for
a word or phrase) and phonograms (a symbol
representing a sound), during the period of
unification. Tax assessment and collection
likely necessitated the initial development of
Hieroglyphics. Ancient Egyptians eventually used
three different scripts: Hieroglyphic, Hieratic,
and Demotic. Hieroglyphics remained the script
of choice for ritual texts. Students of Egyptian
history are most familiar with hieroglyphics as

CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
they were usually what artists used to record the history of Egypt’s elite. For example, skilled artisans
used hieroglyphs to chronicle glorified accounts of their patrons’ lives on the sides of their tombs.
The Egyptians developed Hieratic and Demotic, the two other scripts, slightly later and used them
for administrative, commercial, and many other purposes. The Egyptian administration tended to
use ink and papyrus to maintain its official records. On the other hand, literate people used ostraca,
pieces of broken pottery and chips of limestone, for less formal notes and communications. Over
the past decades, archaeologists have uncovered a treasure trove of ostraca that start to tell us about
the lives of the literate elite and skilled craftsmen. Just like Mesopotamia, ancient Egypt had one of
the oldest written scripts found anywhere in the world.
In addition to one of the earliest writing systems and Egyptian paper (papyrus), archaeologists
have credited ancient Egyptians with a number of other innovations. For construction purposes,
ancient Egyptians invented the ramp and lever. They also developed a 12-month calendar with
365 days, glassmaking skills, arithmetic (including one of the earliest decimal systems) and
geometry, and medical procedures to heal broken bones and relieve fevers. Finally, Egyptians
used stone-carving techniques and other crafting skills and tools that were shared throughout
the Mediterranean.

Scholars break the 1500 years following unification, a time known as dynastic Egypt, into
three main periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 2660–2160 BCE), the Middle Kingdom (c. 2040 – 1640
BCE), and the New Kingdom (c. 1530–1070 BCE). There is some disagreement about the exact
dates of the periods, but, in general, these spans denote more centralized control over a unified
Egypt. During dynastic Egypt, pharaohs ruled a united Upper and Lower Egypt. In between these
periods of centralized control were intermediate periods, during which the Egyptian pharaohs
had less authority. The intermediate periods were characterized by political upheaval and military
violence, the latter often at least partially resulting from foreign invasions.
Striking continuities existed in Egypt throughout the Old Kingdom, the Middle Kingdom,
and the New Kingdom. Egypt had stable population numbers, consistent social stratification,
pharaohs—who exercised significant power—and a unifying religious ideology, which linked the
pharaohs to the gods. As Egypt transitioned from the period of unification under King Narmer
to the Old Kingdom, the pharaohs and the elite became increasingly wealthy and powerful. They
further developed earlier systems of tax collection, expanded the religious doctrine, and built a
huge state bureaucracy.
Social distinctions and hierarchies remained fairly consistent through all of dynastic Egypt.
Most people were rural peasant farmers. They lived in small mud huts just above the flood plain
and turned over surplus agricultural produce to the state as taxes. When they weren’t farming, they
were expected to perform rotating service for the state, by, for example, working on a pharaoh’s
tomb, reinforcing dykes, and helping in the construction of temples. The labor of the majority of
the population supported the more elite and skilled classes, from the pharaoh down through the
governing bureaucrats, priests, nobles, soldiers, and skilled craftspeople, especially those who

worked on pyramids and tombs. (Visit

Another continuity in dynastic
Egypt was the relative equality of
women to men. At least compared
to women in other ancient societies,
women in ancient Egypt had
considerable legal rights and freedoms.
Men and women did generally have
different roles; Egyptian society
charged men with providing for the
family and women with managing the
home and children. Society’s ascribed
gender roles meant that women were
usually defined primarily by their
husbands and children, while men
were defined by their occupations. This
difference could leave women more
economically vulnerable than men. For
example, in the village of craftspeople
who worked on the pharaoh’s tomb at
Deir el Medina, houses were allocated
to the men who were actively employed.
This system of assigning housing
meant that women whose husbands
had died would be kicked out of their
homes as replacement workers were
brought in. Despite some vulnerability,
Egyptian law was pretty equal between
the sexes when it came to many other
issues. Egyptian women could own
property, and tax records show that
they did. Egyptian women could also
take cases to court, enter into legally
binding agreements, and serve actively
as priestesses. There were also female
pharaohs, most famously Hatshepsut

who ruled for twenty years in the
fifteenth century BCE. One last, perhaps
surprising, legal entitlement of ancient
Egyptian women was their right to
one-third of the property that a couple
accumulated over the course of their
marriage. Married women had some
financial independence, which gave
them options to dispose of their own
property or divorce. Therefore, while
women did face constraints in terms
of their expected roles and had their
status tied to the men in their families,
they nevertheless enjoyed economic
freedoms and legal rights not commonly
seen in the ancient world.
While scholars working over the
past several decades have used artwork,
archeology, and the surviving legal
documents to draw conclusions about
women’s roles in ancient Egypt, there
is much ongoing debate about the
prevalence of slavery within this society. Part of the disagreement stems from how various scholars
define slavery. There is also great uncertainty about the number of slaves within the Egyptian
population. The emerging consensus suggests that Egyptians increasingly used slaves from the
Middle Kingdom onward. The majority of the slaves in these later dynasties were either prisoners
of war or slaves brought from Asia. Slaves performed many tasks. For example, they labored in
agricultural fields, served in the army, worked in construction, helped their merchant owners in
shops, and were domestic servants for the Egyptian elite. Slaves were branded and, if possible,
would be captured and returned to their masters if they tried to escape. Some masters undoubtedly
abused their slaves, though the image of thousands of slaves sacrificed to be buried with pharaohs
incorrectly depicts dynastic Egypt. Manumission (freeing a slave) was seemingly not very common,
but if they were freed, former slaves were not stigmatized; instead, they were considered part of
the general free population. These new scholarly conclusions about the relatively small numbers
of slaves in Egypt, especially during the Old Kingdom, have impacted our understanding of how
pyramids, tombs, and temples were constructed during dynastic Egypt.
The Old Kingdom saw pharaohs harness their influence to build pyramids to emphasize
their relationship to the divine and facilitate their ascent to the gods after their earthly deaths.
Pyramids, with their distinctive shape, which you can see in Figure 2.9, contained tombs for the
pharaohs and their wives. They were marvels of engineering, built on a massive scale to honor the
pharaohs and usher them into the afterlife. Pharaohs were mummified to preserve their bodies and

were buried with everything considered necessary for the afterlife, including furniture, jewelry,
makeup, pottery, food, wine, clothing, and sometimes even pets. The most recognizable pyramids
from the Old Kingdom are the three pyramids at the Giza complex, which were built for a father
(Egyptian pharaoh Khufu), and his son and grandson, who all ruled during the fourth dynasty.
The Great Pyramid of Giza, built for Pharaoh Khufu, is the largest of the three pyramids.
Still largely intact today, it was the largest building in the world until the twentieth century.
Over 500 feet high, it covered an area of 200 square yards, and was built with over 600 tons of
limestone. Recent studies on the construction of the pyramids have put much more emphasis on
the roles of skilled craftsmen—who might work at multiple pyramid sites over the course of their
lifetimes—and rotating groups of unskilled workers than on slaves. These studies suggest that
skilled craftsmen and local labor forces of Egyptians were the primary builders of the pyramids,
including the Great Pyramid of Giza. The Great Pyramid of Giza took an estimated 20 years to
construct and employed skilled stonemasons, architects, artists, and craftsmen, in addition to the
thousands of unskilled laborers who did the heavy moving and lifting. The construction of the
Great Pyramid of Giza was an enormous, expensive feat. The pyramid stands as testimony to the

increased social differentiation, the great power and wealth of the Egyptian pharaohs, and the
significance of beliefs in the afterlife during the Old Kingdom.
In addition to the construction of pyramids, the Old Kingdom saw increased trade and
remained a relatively peaceful period. The pharaoh’s government controlled trade, with Egypt
exporting grain and gold (the latter from Nubia to the south) and importing timber, spices, ivory,
and other luxury goods. During the Old Kingdom, Egypt did not have a standing army and faced
few foreign military threats. Lasting almost 400 years, the Old Kingdom saw the extension of the
pharaoh’s power, especially through the government’s ability to harness labor and control trade.
However, the power of the pharaohs began to wane in the fifth dynasty of the Old Kingdom.
Continuing environmental change that led to droughts and famine, coupled with the huge expense
of building pyramids likely impoverished pharaohs in the last centuries of the Old Kingdom.
Additionally, the governors known as nomes, who administered Egypt’s 42 provinces from the fifth
dynasty onward, became more independent and took over functions that had been overseen by the
state. As an added blow, the pharaohs lost control of trade. While dynastic leaders still referred to
themselves as pharaohs, they lacked central authority over a unified Egypt by 2180 BCE.
Following the decentralized First Intermediate Period of roughly 150 years, Pharaoh
Mentohotep II reunified Egypt to found the Middle Kingdom. The Middle Kingdom saw the
reorganization of the state’s bureaucratic apparatus to control the nomes. To further strengthen
their authority, the pharaohs also moved their capital from the Old Kingdom capital of Thebes
south to Lisht, halfway between Upper and Lower Egypt. With military expeditions, they extended
the boundaries of the state north to Lebanon and south to the second cataract of the Nile into a
region known as Nubia. With this extension of territory, Egypt had access to more trade goods, and
the organization of trade shifted so that professional merchants took a leading role in developing
new trade routes. These professional merchants paid taxes to the state, supporting further
consolidation of power by the pharaohs and also infrastructural improvements like irrigation.
During the Middle Kingdom, the pharaohs focused less on the building of massive pyramids and
more on administrative reorganization, military expeditions, and the state’s infrastructural repair.
Disputes over succession and ineffectual rulers led into the Second Intermediate Period. Most
notably, Egypt was invaded from both the north and the south during this period. The Hyksos
invaded from the north in 1670 BCE. They brought bronze and horse-drawn chariots, which
allowed them to conquer parts of Lower Egypt and establish their own kingdom, one lasting about
100 years in the Nile Delta region. From the south, the Kingdom of Kush, based in Nubia, invaded
and temporarily established control over Upper Egypt to Aswan. Thus, foreign rulers dominated
much of Egypt during the Second Intermediate Period.
The New Kingdom of reunified Egypt that began in 1530 BCE saw an era of Egyptian
imperialism, changes in the burial practices of pharaohs, and the emergence of a brief period
of state-sponsored monotheism under the Pharaoh Akhenaten. In 1530 BCE, the pharaoh who
became known as Ahmose the Liberator (Ahmose I) defeated the Hyksos and continued sweeping
up along the Eastern Mediterranean. By 1500 BCE, the Egyptian army had also pushed into Nubia,
taking Kush southward to the fourth cataract of the Nile River (see Map 2.8). As pharaohs following
Ahmose I continued Egypt’s expansion, the Imperial Egyptian army ran successful campaigns in 
Page | 50
Palestine and Syria, along the Eastern
Mediterranean. Furthermore, by
expanding into Kush, Egypt controlled
trade routes into Sub-Saharan Africa.
Adopting the Hyksos’ chariot military
and metal technologies contributed
to the Egyptian ability to strengthen
its military. Egypt maintained a large
standing army and built an expansive
empire during the New Kingdom.
Egypt saw many other developments
during the New Kingdom, especially
when it came to burial practices and
religion. During the New Kingdom,
pharaohs and Egyptian elites used
the Valley of Kings, located across
the Nile River from Thebes, as their
preferred burial site. They desired
tombs that were hidden away and safe
from tomb robbers. Therefore, instead
of pyramids, they favored huge stone
tombs built into the mountains of
the Valley of the Kings. Nearly all of
the tombs in the Valley of Kings were
raided, so the fears of the pharaohs
were well founded. Tomb raiding
was even common during dynastic Egypt. King Tutankhamen’s tomb has become one familiar
exception. His tomb fared unusually well over the millennia, and King Tutankhamen’s image is
well known to us because his tomb was found mostly intact in 1922.
Throughout dynastic Egypt, much continuity existed in religious beliefs, causing scholars to
characterize Egyptian society as conservative, meaning that Egyptians shied away from change.
In general, Egyptian religious beliefs emphasized unity and harmony. Throughout the dynastic
period, Egyptians thought that the soul contained distinct parts. They believed that one part, the
ka, was a person’s lifeforce and that it separated from the body after death. The Egyptians carried
out their elaborate preservation of mummies and made small tomb statues to house their ka after
death. The ba, another part of the soul,was the unique character of the individual, which could move
between the worlds of the living and the dead. They believed that after death, if rituals were carried
out correctly, their ka and ba would reunite to reanimate their akh, or spirit. If they observed the
proper rituals and successfully passed through Final Judgment (where they recited the 42 “Negative
Confessions” and the god Osiris weighed their hearts against a feather), Egyptians believed that
their resurrected spirit, their akh, would enter the afterlife. In contrast to Mesopotamian society,

CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
Egyptians conceptualized the afterlife as
pleasant. In the afterlife, they expected
to find a place with blue skies, agreeable
weather, and familiar objects and people.
They also expected to complete many
of the everyday tasks, such as farming,
and enjoy many of the same recognizable
pastimes. Throughout the centuries, the
Egyptians conceptualized the afterlife as a
comfortable mirror image of life.
One change that occurred over time
was the “democratization of the afterlife.”
As time progressed through the Middle
Kingdom and into the New Kingdom, more
and more people aspired to an afterlife. No
longer was an afterlife seen as possible for
only the pharaoh and the elite of society. Instead,
just about all sectors of society expected access, as
evident in the increased use of funeral texts, like
the Book of the Dead. People of varying means
would slip papyrus with spells or prayers from the
Book of the Dead (or a similar text) into coffins
and burial chambers. They intended these spells
to help their deceased loved ones make it safely
through the underworld into the pleasant afterlife.
Conceptualizations of the afterlife consistently
emphasized its familiarity and beauty, while more
people looked forward to this continued existence
after their earthly deaths.
As they developed religious doctrine and came
into contact with new deities, Egyptians integrated
new gods and goddesses into their religious beliefs.
Like ancient Mesopotamians, Egyptians were
polytheistic. Some of the roles and back-stories of
the deities did change over time; nevertheless, over
the millennia they remained quite consistent. For
example, Re, Osiris, Horus, and Isis, just to name
a few deities in the Egyptian pantheon, stayed
significant throughout dynastic Egypt. Re was the

sun god, Osiris was the god of the afterworld, who also controlled nature’s cycles (like the all
important flooding of the Nile), Horus became a god of war and protection, and Isis was a goddess
associated with healing and motherhood. During the Middle Kingdom, Amun, initially a patron
saint of the city of Thebes and later recognized as the father of the pharaoh, was combined with Re,
the sun god, to become Amun-Re the supreme god of the Egyptian pantheon. Amun-Re retained
this place at the top of the Egyptian pantheon through most of the New Kingdom. One major
exception occurred during the reign of Pharaoh Akhenaten.
Pharaoh Akhenaten started what is known as the Amarna Period. The Amarna Period, which
lasted from approximately 1350 to 1325 BCE, stands out for its state-sponsored monotheism.
Akhenaten introduced radical changes to Egyptian society, moving the capital to Tell el Amarna,
a new settlement in the middle of the desert that was devoted to the worship of Aten and the
recognition of the pharaoh’s superiority over everyone else. Aten, who had been one of many
deities worshipped during the Middle Kingdom, was elevated to the creator god associated with
sunlight, the foundation of all life. The “Great Hymn to Aten” explains the god Aten’s association
with the sun as, like the sun, his “rays embraced the lands” of Egypt.8 Akhenaten had the Great
Temple of Aten built in the middle of the new capital, and, unlike previous temples, this one
had no roof and was open to sunlight. Akhenaten further modified Egyptian religious doctrine to
identify himself as the son of Aten. According to the new religious ideology, Akhenaten alone was
able to ensure access to the afterlife and communicate with Aten, the sole god. To reinforce Aten’s
singularity, Akhenaten withdrew financial support from temples dedicated to other deities and
defaced the temples dedicated to Amun, who had previously been the most dominant Egyptian
deity. The prominence of Aten and Akhenaten’s exclusive access to him define the Amarna Period.
Why did Akhenaten introduce these radical changes? At least in part, Akhenaten wanted
to break with the priests in Thebes who controlled the temples dedicated to Amun because he
believed that these priests had become too powerful. Additionally, by taking on the role of the
son of Aten and regulating entry into the afterlife, Akhenaten certainly attempted to reformulate
beliefs to emphasize his own importance.
Akhenaten’s radical changes were likely troubling for most of the Egyptian population. They had
previously found comfort in their access to deities and their regular religious rituals. The worship
of Aten as the only Egyptian god did not last more than a couple of decades, floundering after the
death of Akhenaten. Pharaohs who ruled from 1323 BCE onward tried not only to erase the religious
legacies of the Amarna Period, but also to destroy the capital at Tell el Amarna and remove Akhenaten
from the historical record. Archaeologists have not found Akhenaten’s tomb or burial place. Scholars
continue a long-standing debate about how this brief period of Egyptian monotheism relates (if at
all) to the monotheism of the Israelites. Despite such uncertainties, study of the Amarna period
does indicate that Egyptians in the fourteenth century BCE saw the fleeting appearance of religious
ideology that identified Aten as the singular god.
Some of the strongest rulers of the New Kingdom, including Ramses I and Ramses II, came to
power after the Amarna Period. These pharaohs expanded Egypt’s centralized administration and its

control over foreign territories. However,
by the twelfth century BCE, weaker rulers,
foreign invasions, and the loss of territory
in Nubia and Palestine indicated the
imminent collapse of the New Kingdom.
In the Late Period that followed (c. 1040
to 332 BCE), the Kingdom of Kush, based
in Nubia, invaded and briefly ruled Egypt
until the Assyrians conquered Thebes,
establishing their own rule over Lower
Egypt. Egyptian internal revolts and
the conquest by Nubia and the Assyrian
Empire left Egypt susceptible to invasion
by the Persians and then eventually the
332 BCE invasion of Alexander the Great.
The ancient Egyptians made numerous
contributions to World History. We
remember them for mummification, their
pharaohs, and the pyramids. Certainly,
in this era, Egypt stands out for its
ability to produce agricultural surpluses
that supported the elites, priests, and
skilled craftspeople. While we tend to
focus on the bureaucratic, religious, and
artistic contributions of these classes, all
Egyptians played crucial roles in creating
and maintaining this sophisticated
civilization. Additionally, the innovations
of Egyptians, such as their stone-carving techniques, hieroglyphics, the use of papyrus, their
knowledge of the length of a solar year, and their construction methods, influenced the ancient
world and still inspire awe. Overall, the ancient Egyptians created a vibrant civilization, while they
also found comfort in the familiar and traditional.
2.15 NUBIA: THE KINGDOMS OF KERMA AND KUSH
The region south of Aswan, at the first cataract of the Nile River, is commonly called Nubia.
Nubia is notable for its long-term, dynamic relationship with ancient Egypt. Just as importantly,
Nubia was also the site of an early civilization. The kingdoms of Kerma (c. 2400 BCE to 1500 BCE)
and Kush (c. 1000 BCE to 300 CE) emerged along the Nile River. These kingdoms prospered
especially due to their productive agriculture and the region’s copious natural resources. At
certain points, both Kerma and Kush were strong enough to successfully invade Egypt. These

kingdoms in Nubia also developed their own religious and cultural traditions, including a written
script, Meroitic. While the people of this region, known collectively as Nubians, borrowed heavily
from the Egyptians, Nubians also had distinctive practices that set their civilization apart from
that of their northern neighbors.
Scholars generally link the origins of ancient Kerma (in present-day Sudan) back to the
desiccation of the Sahara Desert and the rise of dynastic Egypt. Similarly to ancient Egypt, the
drying out of the region encouraged people
to move closer to the Nile River in the
years between 5,000 and 4,000 BCE. Rock
paintings, showing cattle in areas that have
been desert for thousands of years, attest
to the environmental changes in Nubia and
also the development of a cattle culture that
dates back to at least the fourth millennium
BCE. Just as in Egypt, the desiccation of the
Sahara desert drew together people from
all directions. As people settled closer to
the Nile River in Nubia, they brought their
cattle, their agricultural traditions, and their
languages, building settlements with higher
population densities.
Additionally, Egyptian elites desired ivory,
animal skins, incense, and other luxury goods
prompting trade between Nubia and Egypt
that pre-dated the unification of Egypt. With
increased demand for luxury goods as social
stratification grew, the Egyptians even ran
military forays into Nubia. After unification,
the Egyptians continued to invade Nubia to
trade and raid for slaves and cattle. Likely,
Nubian desires to control trade and protect
themselves from Egyptian raids further compelled state formation in Nubia. Without Nubian
records from the third millennium BCE, it is difficult to identify additional reasons why the state
arose. However, archeological evidence does clearly indicate that by about 2400 BCE, Nubians had
formed the Kingdom of Kerma between the third and fourth cataracts of the Nile River.
2.15.1 Kerma (c. 2400 BCE to c. 1500 BCE)
Kerma endured in Upper Nubia for almost a thousand years. The kingdom is named after
its capital city at Kerma at the third cataract, but excavations at other sites (where similar
pottery styles and burial sites have been found) suggest that at its height Kerma’s reach may

CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
have extended more than 200 miles southward past the fifth cataract of the Nile River. So far,
archaeological evidence indicates that, with the exception of the capital and perhaps one or two
other cities, most of the people in Kerma lived in smaller villages. They grew crops like barley,
and kept goats, sheep, and cattle, sending tribute to their capital. The people of Kerma also
developed industries, especially in mining, metalworking, and pottery. Kerma was linked interregionally through trade to its tributary villages, to dynastic Egypt, and to sub-Saharan Africa.
Egyptian pharaohs and elites wanted the gold, copper, slaves, ivory, exotic animals, and more
that they obtained from Kerma.
The people of Kerma also made use of their location on the Nile and proximity to Egypt as they
imported textiles, jewelry, and other manufactured goods. Presumably, one reason that Nubian
leaders built their ancient capital at Kerma was to oversee river trade. At the impassable cataract,
boat owners unloaded their cargo and took it overland past the shallows and rocks before again
proceeding on the water. This location at the cataract gave the leaders at Kerma the chance to tax,
divert, and register goods being transported between Kerma and Egypt.
Agricultural surpluses and other tributary payments supported the rulers and elites of the
capital. Archaeologists have shown that the capital had defenses, including ditches, ramparts, and
massive walls with towers. There were also palaces within the city and on its outskirts. However,
the most famous structure is the Western Deffufa (Figure 2.13) made of mud-bricks, which likely
served as a temple. Two other deffufa, large mud-brick structures with spaces for rituals on top,
have been at least partially excavated within the vicinity of Kerma. Another notable archaeological
find is the Eastern Cemetery, which lies a couple of miles to the east of the city. It served as the
burial site for Kerma’s rulers for almost a thousand years and contains over 30,000 tombs. Some
of the tombs were covered with
large mounds. Demonstrating
the cattle culture of the region,
dozens of cattle skulls encircle
a number of the tombs. Tombs
also contain the remains of
human sacrifices and other
symbols of wealth and status,
like jewelry made of gold
and silver. The largest tomb
found to date is 300 feet in
diameter and covered with
black granite, white quartz
pebbles, and a marble top. Its
interior burial suite contains
semi-precious stones, bronze
weapons, and lavish furniture.
In the corridor leading into
the underground burial site,

archaeologists unearthed the remains of horses, dogs, and about 400 human sacrificial victims.
The cattle skulls, mounds, and the remains of human sacrifices have led scholars to suggest that
the Kerma elite had their own styles for monumental structures like the Western Deffufa and their
tombs, even though they sometimes employed Egyptian artisans to complete the construction of
these grand projects.
It appears that Kerma was strongest when neighboring Egypt was weak. As a case in point,
during Egypt’s Second Intermediate Period, Kerma, at the height of its power, successfully
invaded parts of Upper Egypt and established diplomatic relations with the occupying Hyksos.
Once reunified during the New Kingdom, Egypt retaliated by conquering Kerma to the fourth
cataract. Then, Egypt occupied Kerma for the next 500 years. During the Egyptian occupation, the
elite classes of Kerma adopted many elements of Egyptian culture, including Egyptian gods, styles
of dress, Hieroglyphics, and the Egyptian language. However, scholars believe that the Nubian
masses retained their own distinctive identity with their local language and customs.
2.15.2 The Kingdom of Kush
As Egypt entered its Third Intermediate Period, Nubians gradually established their
independence, eventually creating a new state, the Kingdom of Kush in the eighth century BCE.
The initial capital of the Kingdom of Kush was Napata (c. 750 BCE to 593 BCE). From Napata,
the Nubians took control of Upper Egypt, establishing the “Ethiopian Dynasty,” which ruled for
60 years from Thebes. Assyrian invasions destabilized the Nubian rulers in Thebes, causing the
last pharaoh of the Ethiopian Dynasty to flee to Napata. Then, once strengthened, the Egyptians
pushed back. The Egyptian army sacked Napata in 593 BCE and, in response, the Nubian rulers
moved their capital farther south to Meroe. (See Map 2.9.) At this southern location, they further
developed their civilization, which lasted until the fourth century CE.
With the new capital at Meroe, a location with well-watered farmland and some distance
between it and Egypt, the Kingdom of Kush flourished. Meroe got more rainfall than Napata and
was not as dependent on the Nile floods. Nubians were able to extend the areas under cultivation
and grow a wider variety of crops, like cotton, sorghum, and millet. They were also able to easily
graze their livestock and, as a result, during this period cattle became even more important as a
symbol of their culture and wealth.
After moving the capital to Meroe, the culture of Kush showed more independence from
Egypt as well. Particularly as Egypt’s power declined, the people of Kush put more emphasis on
their own deities and pushed Egyptian gods to the background. For example, temples devoted
to a Nubian war god, Apedamak, “the Lion of the South,” received more support and even used
live lions for rituals. Gold had long been mined in the region and remained important while the
people of Kush continued to develop additional industries. The area was rich in iron ore and the
hardwoods used to make charcoal, which encouraged the growth of a booming iron industry.
They made iron weapons and tools that they used for defense and to increase their crop yields.
They were able to trade their agricultural surpluses, iron, cattle, and exotic things like elephants
from sub-Saharan Africa, with Egypt, Greece, Rome, and India, bringing great wealth and

CHAPTER 2: EARLY MIDDLE EASTERN AND NORTHEAST AFRICAN CIVILIZATIONS
prestige to Meroe. Also, the rulers
of Meroe commissioned pyramids
but had them built in a local
style. As evident in Figure 2.14,
their pyramids were smaller and
had a unique shape. Kush burial
practices were different than those
used in dynastic Egypt, as corpses
were not always mummified and
were buried in the fetal position.
Finally, a new locally-created
written script, Meroitic, replaced
the use of Egyptian Hieroglyphics
by 300 BCE. Modern scholars
have not yet translated Meroitic,
and students of their culture will
surely learn even more about the
Kingdom of Kush once scholars
have done so. As for now, we know that very productive agriculture, local rituals and burial
practices, the growth of industries, social stratification facilitated by Meroe’s wealth and
extensive trade networks, and the written script Meroitic, were some of the distinctive elements
of the civilization at Kush.
While the Greeks and Romans occasionally sent raiding parties into Nubia, for a while, Meroe’s
southern location helped isolate it from conquest. Legends also emphasize the strength of Meroe’s
army and the physical prowess of its soldiers. Environmental changes, internal rivalries, and the
rise of Axum (a new state to the East) likely all contributed to the fairly abrupt collapse of Meroe
in the fourth century CE.
Egyptian sources were generally very derogatory in their portrayal of Nubians and even a
few early twentieth century archaeologists carelessly (and incorrectly) identified these Nubian
kingdoms as slave colonies of the Egyptians. However, the kingdoms of Kerma and Kush were
known in the ancient world for their wealth and industries. The wealth garnered through productive
agriculture and trade supported a ruling class, great artists, and monumental architecture.
Egyptian culture was influential, but Nubians adapted Egyptian practices to meet their own needs
and sensibilities. Often entangled with Egypt and sometimes defending themselves from other
invaders as well, these two kingdoms persisted for hundreds of years, creating an independent
civilization along the southern stretches of the Nile River.
2.16 SUMMARY
Between about 4000 and 3000 BCE, civilizations emerged in the fertile river valleys of
Mesopotamia and Northeast Africa. These civilizations had common elements, including

food surpluses, higher population densities, social stratification, systems of taxation, labor
specialization, regular trade, and written scripts.
In areas adjacent to the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers, Mesopotamians built city-states by 3500
BCE. While Sumerian traditions influenced developments throughout the region, other cities
emerged and refined their own institutions and beliefs. Archaeological finds and records in the
cuneiform script show the significance of the temple complex and religious leaders throughout
Mesopotamia. Kingship, with hereditary rulers who claimed control over multiple city-states and
special relationships with the gods, was just one significant political innovation in the region.
History credits Sargon of Akkad with founding the first empire in Mesopotamia. Thereafter, a
succession of empires rose and fell, demonstrating the dynamic nature of Mesopotamian societies.
According to Hebrew Tradition, Abraham led his followers from the city of Ur in Mesopotamia
and they eventually settled in the Levant. Several generations later, according to Hebrew Tradition,
the Israelites went to Egypt where they suffered persecution and enslavement, until Moses liberated
them. Upon their return to Canaan, the Israelites built kingdoms just prior to 1000 BCE. Their
kingdoms formed complex administrations and were unified by powerful kings, such as the wellknown King Solomon. Historians also recognize countless other contributions made by the Israelites,
especially as regards monotheistic religious traditions and western understandings of justice.
The unification of Egypt in approximately 3100 BCE evidenced the emergence of one civilization
in Northeast Africa. In Nubia to the south of Egypt, Africans built another civilization with the
kingdoms of Kerma and Kush. The people in each of these civilizations made good use of the
agriculturally productive floodplains of the Nile River. Egypt and the kingdoms in Nubia influenced
one another; they traded and intermittently claimed control over each other’s territory. While we may
be more familiar with the pharaohs, pyramids, and religious beliefs of ancient Egypt, Nubians made
their own contributions, like the Merotic script and unique architectural styles, to World History

 India’s dynamic history, then, alternated between periods when the subcontinent was partially
unified by empires and periods when it was composed of a shifting mosaic of regional states. This
history was also impacted by influxes of migrants and invaders. In thinking about the reasons for
these patterns, historians highlight the size of India and its diverse geography and peoples.
It is important to remember that “India” can mean different things. Today, India usually
designates the nation-state of India (see Map 3.1). But modern India only formed in 1947 and
includes much less territory than India did in ancient times. As a term, India was first invented by
the ancient Greeks to refer to the Indus River and the lands and people beyond it. When used
in this sense, India also includes today’s nation of Pakistan. In fact, for the purpose of studying
earlier history, India can be thought of as the territory that includes at least seven countries today:
India, Pakistan, Bhutan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives. This territory is also
referred to as South Asia or the Indian subcontinent.
The Indian subcontinent is where Indian civilization took shape. But that civilization was not
created by one people, race, or ethnic group, and it doesn’t make sense to see India’s history as
the history of one Indian people. Rather, the history of this region was shaped by a multitude
of ethnic groups who spoke many different languages and lived and moved about on a diverse
terrain suited to many different kinds of livelihood.

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
Large natural boundaries define the
subcontinent. Mountain ranges ring
the north, and bodies of water surround
the rest. To the east lies the Bay of
Bengal, to the south the Indian Ocean,
and to the west the Arabian Sea. The
largest mountain range is the Himalaya,
which defines India’s northern and
northeastern boundary. A subrange
of the Himalaya—the Hindu Kush—
sits at its western end, while a ridge
running from north to south defines
the eastern end, dividing India from
China and mainland Southeast Asia.
To the northwest, the Suleiman Range
and Kirthar Range complete what
might seem like impassable barriers.
Yet, these ranges are punctuated by a
few narrow passes that connect India
to Central Asia and West Asia.
To the south of the mountain ranges
lie the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the
two great rivers of northern India that
comprise it: the Indus River and the
Ganges River. These rivers originate
in the Himalaya and are regularly fed
by snow melt and monsoon rains. The Indus River, which is located in the northwest and drains
into the Arabian Sea, can be divided into an upper and lower region. The region comprising the
upper Indus and its many tributary rivers is called the Punjab, while the region surrounding the
lower Indus is referred to as the Sindh. The Ganges River begins in the western Himalaya and
flows southeast across northern India before draining into the Bay of Bengal. Because they could
support large populations, the plains surrounding these river systems served as the heartland for
India’s first major states and empires.
Peninsular India is also an important part of the story because over time great regional kingdoms
will also emerge in the south. The peninsula is divided from northern India by the Vindhya Mountains,
to the south of which lies the Deccan Plateau. This arid plateau is bordered by two coastal ranges—
the Western Ghats and Eastern Ghats, beyond which are narrow coastal plains, the Malabar Coast
and the Coromandel Coast. This nearly 4600 miles of coastline is important to India’s history
because it linked fishing and trading communities to the Indian Ocean and, therefore, the rest of
Afro-Eurasia. Sri Lanka is an island located about thirty kilometers southeast of the southernmost
tip of India, and also served as an important conduit for trade and cultural contacts beyond India.

3.6 INDIA’S FIRST MAJOR CIVILIZATION: THE INDUS
VALLEY CIVILIZATION (2600 BCE – 1700 BCE)
A century of archaeological work in India that began in 1920 not only revealed a lost civilization
but also a massive one, surpassing in size other major early riverine civilizations of Afro-Eurasia,
such as ancient Egypt and the Mesopotamian states. In an area spanning roughly a half million
square miles, archaeologists have excavated thousands of settlements (see Map 3.2). These can
be envisioned in a hierarchy based on size and sophistication. The top consists of five major cities
of roughly 250 acres each. One of those is Harappa, and because it was excavated first the entire
civilization was named Harappan Civilization. The bottom of the hierarchy consists of fifteen
thousand smaller agricultural and craft villages of about 2.5 acres each, while between the top and
bottom lie two tiers with several dozen towns ranging in size from 15 to 150 acres. Because the

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
majority of these settlements were situated near the Indus River in the northwestern region of the
subcontinent, this civilization is also called the Indus Valley Civilization.
As with ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, archaeologists have been able to sketch out how
this civilization evolved out of the simpler agricultural villages of the Neolithic period. On the
subcontinent, farming and the domestication of animals began c. 7000 BCE, about two thousand
years after they did in the Fertile Crescent. To the west of the Indus River, along the foothills of
Baluchistan, the remains of numerous small villages have been found that date back to this time
(see Map 3.3). One of these is Mehrgarh. Here, villagers lived in simple mud-brick structures,
grew barley and wheat, and raised cattle, sheep, and goats.
Over the course of the next three thousand years, similar Neolithic communities sprang up
not only in northwest India but also in many other locations on the subcontinent. But it was to the
Map 3.3 | Archaeological sites dating to northwest India’s Neolithic period and the Indus Valley Civilization |
Agricultural village societies first emerged to the west of the Indus and then spread to the Indus River and its many
tributaries, as well as the Ghaggar-Hakra River (running parallel to and east of the Indus), which has since dried
up. These provided the foundation for the emergence of towns and cities.

west of the Indus River and then throughout neighboring fertile plains and valleys of the Punjab
and Sindh that we see the transition to a more complex, urban-based civilization. Excavations
throughout this region show a pattern of development whereby settlements start looking more
like towns than villages: ground plans become larger, include the foundations of houses and
streets, and are conveniently located by the most fertile land or places for trade. Similar artifacts
spread over larger areas show that the local communities building these towns were becoming
linked together in trade networks. Archaeologists date this transitional period when India was on
the verge of its first civilization from 5000 to 2600 BCE. The mature phase, with its full-blown
cities, begins from 2600 BCE, roughly four centuries after the Sumerian city-states blossomed
and Egypt was unified under one kingdom.
The ruins of Mohenjo-Daro and other Indus cities dating to this mature phase suggest a
vibrant society thriving in competently planned and managed urban areas. Some of the principal
purposes of these urban settlements included coordinating the distribution of local surplus
resources, obtaining desired goods from more distant places, and turning raw materials into
commodities for trade. Mohenjo-Daro, for instance, was located along the lower reaches of the
Indus (see Figure 3.2). That meant it was conveniently built amidst an abundance of resources:
fertile flood plains for agriculture, pasture for grazing domesticated animals, and waters for fishing
and fowling. The city itself consisted of several mounds—elevated areas upon which structures
and roads were built. A larger mound served as a core, fortified area where public functions
likely took place. It contained a wall and large buildings, including what archaeologists call a
Great Bath and Great Hall. Other mounds were the location of the residential and commercial
sectors of the city. Major avenues laid out on a grid created city blocks. Within a block, multistory
dwellings opening up to interior courtyards were constructed out of mudbricks or bricks baked in

kilns. Particular attention was paid to
public sanitation. Residences not only
had private wells and baths, but also
toilets drained by earthenware pipes
that ushered the sewage into covered
drains located under the streets.
Artifacts tell of city life. Farmers
and pastoralists brought their grain
and stock to the city for trade or to
place it in warehouses managed by the
authorities. Laborers dug the wells
and collected trash from rectangular
bins sitting beneath rubbish chutes.
Craftsmen worked copper and tin
into bronze tools, fired ceramics, and
manufactured jewelry and beads out
of gold, copper, semi-precious stones,
and ivory. Merchants travelling near
and far carried raw materials and
finished goods by bullock carts or boats to the dozens of
towns and cities throughout the region.
Some goods also went to foreign lands. Harappan
cities located along the coast of the Arabian Sea engaged
in coastal shipping that brought goods as far as the Persian
Gulf and the delta of the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers. In
Mesopotamian city-states, Harappan seals and beads
have been found, and Mesopotamian sources speak of a
certain place called “Meluhha,” a land with ivory, gold, and
lapis lazuli. That was the Indus Valley Civilization. Cities
like Mohenjo-Daro were linked in networks of exchange
extending in every direction.
But unlike ancient Egypt and Sumer, this civilization
has not yet provided sources we can read, and this
poses major problems of interpretation. True, over four
thousand inscribed objects with at least four hundred
different signs recurring in various frequencies have
been found on clay, copper tablets, and small, square
seals excavated primarily at the major cities (see Figure
3.3). But the heroic efforts of philologists to decipher
Figure 3.3 | Seals from Indus Valley cities | These were made
from fired steatite and used to imprint the identity of owners on goods.

the language have failed to yield results.
Thus, some historians call this civilization
proto-historic, distinguishing it from both
prehistoric cultures that have no writing
and historic ones with written sources that
we can read.
This proto-historical state of the
evidence leaves many questions concerning
Harappan people’s political organization
and beliefs unanswered. On the one hand,
much uniformity in the archaeological
record across the region suggests
coordination in planning—cities and towns
were similarly designed, fired bricks had the
same dimensions, and weights were standardized. On
the other hand, the ruins lack structures that can be
clearly identified as palaces, temples, or large tombs.
In other words, there is little evidence for either a
central political authority ruling over an empire or for
independent city-states. One intriguing artifact found
in Mohenjo-Daro is a small sculpture of a bearded
man made of soapstone (see Figure 3.4). The dignified
appearance suggests he may have been a priest or king,
or even both. Perhaps he and other priests purified
themselves in the Great Bath for ritual purposes. Yet,
this is purely speculation, as the sculpture is unique.
He may also have been a powerful landowner or
wealthy merchant who met with others of a similar
status in assemblies convened in the Great Hall of the
citadel. Perhaps local assemblies of just such elites
governed each city.
Religious beliefs are also difficult to determine.
Again, some of the principal evidence consists of

small artifacts such as figurines and the square seals. The seals were carved out of a soft stone
called steatite and then fired so they would harden. They contain images of animals and humans,
typically with writing above. Mostly, they were used to imprint the identity of a merchant or
authorities on goods. However, some of the images may have had religious significance. For
example, hundreds of “unicorn seals” display images of a mythical animal that resembles a species
of cattle (see Figure 3.5). These cattle are usually placed over an object variously interpreted as
a trough or altar. Perhaps these were symbols of deities or animals used for sacrificial rituals.
Equally as interesting are the numerous female clay figurines. These may have been used for
fertility rituals or to pay homage to a goddess (see Figure 3.6).
The decline of Harappan civilization set in from 1900 BCE and was complete two hundred
years later. Stated simply, the towns and cities and their lively trade networks faded away, and the
region reverted to rural conditions. Likely causes include geologic, climatic, and environmental
factors. Movement by tectonic plates may have led to earthquakes, flooding, and shifts in the course
of the Indus. Less rainfall and deforestation may have degraded the environment’s suitability for
farming. All of these factors would have impacted the food supply. Consequently, urban areas and
the civilization they supported were slowly starved out of existence.
3.7 THE LONG VEDIC AGE (1700 – 600 BCE)
By 1700 BCE, Harappan Civilization had collapsed. In northwest India, scattered village
communities engaging in agriculture and pastoralism replaced the dense and more highly
populated network of cities, towns, and villages of the third millennium. The rest of northern
India too (including the Ganges River), as well as the entire subcontinent, were similarly dotted
with Neolithic communities of farmers and herders. That is what the archaeological record
demonstrates.
The next stage in India’s history is the Vedic Age (1700 – 600 BCE). This period is named
after a set of religious texts composed during these centuries called the Vedas. The people who
composed them are known as the Vedic peoples and Indo-Aryans. They were not originally from
India, and rather came as migrants travelling to the subcontinent via mountain passes located in
Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Aryans first settled in the Punjab, but then they pushed east along
the Ganges, eventually impressing their way of life, language, and religious beliefs upon much
of northern India. The course of India’s history was completely changed during this period. By
the end of the Vedic Age, numerous states had emerged and Hinduism and the varna social
system were beginning to take shape.
3.7.1 The Early Aryan Settlement of Northern India (1700 – 1000 BCE)
The early history of the Vedic Age offers the historian little primary source material. For example,
for the first half of the Vedic Age (1700 – 1000 BCE), we are largely limited to archaeological sites
and one major text called the Rig Veda. This is the first of four Vedas. It consists of 1028 hymns
addressed to the Vedic peoples’ pantheon of gods. But it wasn’t actually written down until after
500 BCE. Rather, from as early as the beginning of the second millennium BCE, these hymns were 
Page | 74
orally composed and transmitted by Aryan poet-seers, eventually becoming the preserve of a few
priestly clans who utilized them for the specific religious function of pleasing higher powers. Thus,
these hymns only offer certain kinds of information. Yet, despite these limits, historians have
been able to sketch out the Aryan’s way of life in these early centuries, as well as to make solid
arguments about how they came to India.
The Indo-Aryans were pastoralists who migrated to India in waves beginning c. 1700 BCE (see
Map 3.4). They referred to themselves as Aryans, a term meaning “noble” or “respectable.” They
spoke Sanskrit, and used it to transmit their sacred hymns. At first, in search of land, they settled
along the hills and plains of the upper reaches of the Indus River and its tributaries, bringing with
them their pastoral and farming way of life. In their hymns, the Aryans beseech the gods to bless
them with cattle, bounteous harvests, rain, friends, wealth, fame, and sons. From these, it is clear
that herding was the principal occupation and cows were especially prized. But the Aryans also
farmed, as apparent in hymns that speak of plough teams and the cutting and threshing of grain.

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
During these early centuries, led by their pastoral chiefs, some Aryans retained a seminomadic way of life, living in temporary dwellings and then moving about with their herds or
migrating further. Others settled down in villages. In both cases, kinship was especially valued.
At the simplest level, society consisted of extended families of three generations. Fathers were
expected to lead the family as patriarchal heads, while sons were expected to care for the herds,
bring honor through success in battle, and sacrifice for the well-being of their fathers’ souls after
death. They also inherited the property and family name. This suggests that, as is so often the
case for ancient societies, men were dominant and women were subordinate. Yet, women’s roles
weren’t as rigidly defined as they would be in later times, and they had some choice in marriage
and could remarry.
Several extended families, in turn, made up clans, and the members of a clan shared land and
herds. Groups of larger clans also constituted tribes. The Vedas speak of rajas who, at this point,
are best understood as clan or tribal chieftains. These men protected their people and led in times
of battle, for the clans and tribes fought with each other and with the indigenous villagers living
in the northwest prior to the Aryan migrations. In times of war, these chiefs would rely on priests
who ensured the support of the gods by reciting hymns and sacrificing to them. At assemblies of
kinsmen and other wealthy and worthy men from the clan, the rajas distributed war booty. Sudas,
for example, was the chief of the Bharata clan. After settling in the Punjab, the Bharatas were
attacked by neighboring clan confederacies, but drawing on his skills in chariot warfare and the
support of priests, Sudas successfully fought them off.
More than anything else, the Rig Veda reveals the Aryan’s religious ideas. For them, the
universe was composed of the sky, earth, and netherworld. These realms were populated by a host
of divinities and demons responsible for the good and evil and order and disorder blessing and
afflicting the human world. Although one Vedic hymn gives a total of thirty-three gods, many more
are mentioned. That means early Vedic religion was polytheistic. These human-like powers lying
behind all those natural phenomena so close to a people living out on the plains were associated
with the forces of light, good, and order. By chanting hymns to them and sacrificing in the correct
way, the Aryan priests might secure blessings for the people or prevent the demons and spirits on
earth from causing sickness and death. They might also ensure that the souls of the dead would
successfully reach the netherworld, where the spirits of righteous Fathers feasted with King Yama,
the first man to die.
Approaching the gods required neither temples nor images. Rather, a fire was lit in a specially
prepared sacrificial altar. This might take place in a home when the family patriarch was hoping
for a son or on an open plot of land when the clan chieftain wished to secure the welfare of his
people. Priests were called in to perform the ceremony. They would imbibe a hallucinogenic
beverage squeezed from a plant of uncertain identity and chant hymns while oblations of butter,
fruit, and meat were placed in the fire. The gods, it was believed, would descend onto grass strewn
about for them and could partake of the offerings once they were transmuted by the fire.
Indra was among the most beloved of the Vedic gods. As a god of war and the storm, and
as king of the gods, Indra exemplified traits men sought to embody in their lives. He is a great
warrior who smites demons and enemies but who also provides generously for the weak. Agni, 
Page | 76
another favorite, was god of fire and the household hearth. Agni summons the gods to the sacrifice
and, as intermediary between gods and humans, brings the sacrificial offering to them.
3.7.2 The Origins of the Aryan People and the Indo-European Hypothesis
Because the Aryans came to India as migrating pastoralists from mountainous regions to
the northwest of the Indian subcontinent, historians have sought to understand their origins.
Sanskrit has provided important clues because it contains features similar to languages spoken
at some point in Europe, Iran, and Central Asia. For example, although they are vastly different
languages, Latin, Persian, and Sanskrit share similar sounds, vocabulary, and grammar.
On the basis of these shared traits, linguists have constructed a kind of family tree that shows
the historical relationship between these languages (see Figure 3.7). Sanskrit belongs to a group
of languages used in northern India called Indo-Aryan. These languages are closely related to
languages used throughout history in neighboring Iran. Together, all of these are called the IndoFigure 3.7 | Proto-Indo-European Family | Chart showing the relationship between some
languages in the Indo-European Family. Note the location of Sanskrit.

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
Iranian language group. This language group is in turn one of nine branches of related language
groups comprising the Indo-European language family.
Linguists assume these distantly-related languages share a common ancestor. They label that
ancestral language proto-Indo-European and the people who spoke it Indo-Europeans. They
posit a scenario whereby, in stages and over time, groups of these peoples migrated from their
homeland to neighboring areas and settled down. Since this process happened over the course
of many centuries and involved much interaction with other peoples along the way, the ancestral
language evolved into many different ones while retaining some of the original features.
One question, then, is the location of this homeland and the history of the peoples who spoke
these languages as they changed. Many places have been proposed, but at present the most
widely accepted scenario puts this
homeland in the steppe lands of
southern Russia, just to the north
of the Black Sea and Caspian Sea
(see Map 3.5).
Evidence from archaeological
sites suggests that during the third
millennium an Indo-European
people lived in this region as
semi-nomadic pastoralists. They
were likely the first to domesticate
the horse and also improved the
chariot by adding lighter, spoked
wheels. They lived in tribes made
up of extended families and
worshipped numerous sky gods
by offering sacrifices in fire altars.
At some point during this
millennium and over the course
of several centuries, groups of
these peoples left their homeland
and migrated south to the Iranian
Plateau. By 2000 BCE, Indo-Iranian speaking pastoralists were living on the Iranian Plateau and
in Afghanistan. Some among these evolved into the Indo-Aryan speakers living to the northwest
of the Indus. It is these peoples that began to arrive in the Punjab from c. 1700 BCE, with their
Vedic religion, kinship-based social order, and pastoral and farming way of life.
3.7.3 The Later Vedic Age (1000 – 600 BCE)
During the early centuries of the Vedic Age, the world of the Aryan tribes was the rural setting of
the Punjab. Some settlers, however, migrated east to the upper reaches of the Ganges River, setting

the stage for the next period in India’s history, the later Vedic Age. The later Vedic Age differs from
the early Vedic Age in that during these centuries lands along the Ganges River were colonized by
the Aryans and their political, economic, social, and religious life became more complex.
Over the course of these four centuries, Aryan tribes, with horses harnessed to chariots
and wagons drawn by oxen, drove their herds east, migrating along and colonizing the plains
surrounding the Ganges. Historians debate whether this happened through conquest and warfare
or intermittent migration led by traders and people seeking land and opportunity. Regardless, by
600 BCE the Aryans had reached the lower reaches of the Ganges and as far south as the Vindhya
Range and the Deccan Plateau. Most of northern India would therefore be shaped by the Aryan
way of life. But in addition, as they moved into these areas, the Aryans encountered indigenous
peoples and interacted with them, eventually imposing their way of life on them but also adopting
many elements of their languages and customs.
During this time, agriculture became more important and occupations more diverse. As
the lands were cleared, village communities formed. Two new resources made farming more
productive: iron tools and rice. Implements such as iron axes and ploughs made clearing
wilderness and sowing fields easier, and rice paddy agriculture produced more calories per unit
of land. Consequently, population began to grow and people could more easily engage in other
occupations. By the end of this period, the earliest towns had started to form.
Political changes accompanied economic developments. Looking ahead at sixth-century
northern India, the landscape was dominated by kingdoms and oligarchies. That raises the
question of the origins of these two different kinds of states, where different types of central
authority formally governed a defined territory. Clearly, these states began to emerge during the
later Vedic Age, especially after the eighth century.
Prior to this state formation, chiefs (rajas) and their assemblies, with the assistance of priests,
saw to the well-being of their clans. This clan-based method of governing persisted and evolved
into oligarchies. As the Aryans colonized new territory, clans or confederacies of clan would claim
it as their possession, and name it after the ruling family. The heads of clan families or chiefs
of each clan in a confederacy then jointly governed the territory by convening periodically in
assembly halls. A smaller group of leaders managed the deliberations and voting, and carried out
the tasks of day-to-day governing. These kinds of states have been called oligarchies because the
heads of the most powerful families governed. They have also been called republics because these
elites governed by assembly.
But in other territories clan chiefs became kings. These kings elevated themselves over
kinsmen and the assemblies and served as the pivot of an embryonic administrative system.
Their chief priests conducted grand rituals that demonstrated the king’s special relation with the
gods, putting the people in awe of him and giving them the sense that they would be protected.
Treasurers managed the obligatory gifts kings expected in return. Most importantly, kingship
became hereditary, and dynasties started to rule (see Map 3.6).
Society changed too. In earlier times, Aryan society was organized as a fluid three-class social
structure consisting of priests, warriors, and commoners. But during the later Vedic Age, this
social structure became more hierarchical and rigid. A system for classifying people based on 
Page | 79
CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
broad occupational categories was developed by the religious and political leaders in society. These
categories are known as varnas, and there were four of them: Brahmins, Kshatriya, Vaishya, and
Shudra. The Brahmins were the priests, whose duty was to memorize and orally transmit the
Vedas and perform sacrifices so as to maintain good relations with the gods. The Kshatriya were
the chiefs and warriors, whose duty was to govern well and fight. The Vaishya were commoners
who traded and farmed. They were responsible for society’s material prosperity. The Shudras
were servants who labored for others, usually as artisans or by performing menial tasks.
Varnas became hereditary social classes. That means a person was born into one of these
and usually remained there for life, pursuing an occupation included in and marrying someone
belonging to that varna. Varna has also been translated as ritual status. Your varna determined
how pure or polluted you were, and thus what level of participation in rituals you would be allowed

and also who you could associate with. Varna thus defined a social hierarchy. The Brahmins
were the purest and most honored. Warriors were respected for their leadership and supported
the Brahmins, who affirmed their authority by carrying out royal ceremonies. Together, they
dominated society. The Shudras (servants) were the most polluted and could not participate in
any sacrifice or speak freely to members of other varnas. Over time, this way of organizing society
came to be viewed as normal and natural.
During the later Vedic Age, the religion of the Aryans also developed in new directions. As one
of the world’s major religious traditions, Hinduism is multi-faceted and contains many layers of
historical development. The earliest layer is called Brahmanism. Brahmanism begins with the
Rig Veda, which presents a universe controlled by a host of divinities. During the early Vedic Age,
the Aryans explained the world through myths about these higher powers, and their priests sought
to influence them through sacrificial ceremonies. These priests become the Brahmin varna.
This early layer persisted and became even more elaborate. Three new Vedas were added to
the Rig Veda, as well as two sets of texts called Brahmanas and Upanishads. Combined, this
literature, which was composed in Sanskrit, constituted the full Vedic corpus, and became the
preserve of the Brahmins.
The Brahmins weren’t content with the 1028 hymns of the Rig Veda. Later Vedas set the
hymns to music, added prose formulas that were to be uttered in the course of sacrificing to the
divinities, and offered spells and incantations for achieving such goals as warding off disease and
winning a battle. The Brahmanas were primarily handbooks of ritual for the Brahmins. They
explained the meaning of the sacrifices and how to carry them out. Clearly, the Brahmins were
becoming ever more conscious of their role in keeping the universe in good working order by
pleasing and assisting the gods and consecrating kings. Their sacrificial observances became all
the more elaborate, and an essential component of good kingship.
The Upanishads, however, added an entirely new set of ideas. The title means “sitting near” and
points to a setting where sages conveyed spiritual insights to students through dialogue, stories,
and analogies. The Upanishads are records of what was taught and discussed, the earliest dating
to the eighth and seventh centuries BCE. These sages were likely hermits and wanderers who felt
spiritually dissatisfied with the mythological and ritualistic approach of Brahmanism. Rather,
they sought deeper insight into the nature of reality, the origins of the universe, and the human
condition. The concepts that appear throughout these records of the outcome of their search are
brahman (not to be confused with Brahmins), atman, transmigration, and karma.
According to these sages, human beings face a predicament. The universe they live in is created
and destroyed repeatedly over the course of immense cycles of time, and humans wander through
it in an endless succession of deaths and rebirths. This wandering is known as transmigration, a
process that isn’t random, but rather determined by the law of karma. According to this law, good
acts bring a better rebirth, and bad acts a worse one. It may not happen in this lifetime, but one
day virtue will be rewarded and evil punished.
Ultimately, however, the goal is to be liberated from the cycle of death and rebirth. According
to Hindu traditions, the Upanishads reflect spiritual knowledge that was revealed to sages who
undertook an inward journey through withdrawal from the world and meditation. What they

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
discovered is that one divine reality underlies the universe. They called this ultimate reality
brahman. They also discovered that deep within the heart of each person lies the eternal soul. They
called this soul atman. Through quieting the mind and inquiry, the individual can discover atman
and its identity with brahman: the soul is the divine reality. That is how a person is liberated from
the illusion of endless wandering.
In conclusion, by the end of the Vedic Age, northern India had undergone immense changes.
An Aryan civilization emerged and spread across the Indo-Gangetic Plains. This civilization was
characterized by the Brahmin’s religion (Brahmanism), the use of Sanskrit, and the varna social
system. The simpler rural life of the clans of earlier times was giving way to the formation of states,
and new religious ideas were being added to the evolving tradition known today as Hinduism.
3.8 TRANSITION TO EMPIRE: STATES, CITIES, AND NEW
RELIGIONS (600 TO 321 BCE)
The sixth century begins a transitional period in India’s history marked by important
developments. Some of these bring to fruition processes that gained momentum during the late
Vedic Age. Out of the hazy formative stage of state development, sixteen powerful kingdoms and
oligarchies emerged. By the end of this period, one will dominate. Accompanying their emergence,
India entered a second stage of urbanization, as towns and cities become a prominent feature of
northern India. Other developments were newer. The caste system took shape as an institution,
giving Indian society one of its most distinctive traits. Lastly, new religious ideas were put forward
that challenged the dominance of Brahmanism.
3.8.1 States and Cities
The kingdom of Magadha became the most powerful among the sixteen states that dominated
this transitional period, but only over time. At the outset, it was just one of eleven located up and
down the Ganges River (see Map 3.7). The rest were established in the older northwest or central
India. In general, larger kingdoms dominated the Ganges basin while smaller clan-based states
thrived on the periphery. They all fought with each other over land and resources, making this a
time of war and shifting alliances.
The victors were the states that could field the largest armies. To do so, rulers had to mobilize
the resources of their realms. The Magadhan kings did this most effectively. Expansion began
in 545 BCE under King Bimbisara. His kingdom was small, but its location to the south of the
lower reaches of the Ganges River gave it access to fertile plains, iron ore, timber, and elephants.
Governing from his inland fortress at Rajagriha, Bimbisara built an administration to extract
these resources and used them to form a powerful military. After concluding marriage alliances
with states to the north and west, he attacked and defeated the kingdom of Anga to the east.
His son Ajatashatru, after killing his father, broke those alliances and waged war on the Kosala
Kingdom and the Vrijji Confederacy. Succeeding kings of this and two more Magadhan dynasties
continued to conquer neighboring states down to 321 BCE, thus forging an empire. But its reach
was largely limited to the middle and lower reaches of the Ganges River.

To the northwest, external powers gained control. As we have seen, the mountain ranges defining
that boundary contain passes permitting the movement of peoples. This made the northwest a
crossroads, and, at times, the peoples crossing through were the armies of rulers who sought to
control the riches of India. Outside powers located in Afghanistan, Iran, or beyond might extend
political control into the subcontinent, making part of it a component in a larger empire.
One example is the Persian Empire (see Chapter 5). During the sixth century, two kings, Cyrus
the Great and Darius I, made this empire the largest in its time. From their capitals on the Iranian
Plateau, they extended control as far as the Indus River, incorporating parts of northwest India
as provinces of the Persian Empire (see Map 3.8). Another example is Alexander the Great (also
see Chapter 5). Alexander was the king of Macedon, a Greek state. After compelling other Greeks
to follow him, he attacked the Persian Empire, defeating it in 331 BCE. That campaign took his
forces all the way to mountain ranges bordering India. Desiring to find the end of the known
world and informed of the riches of India, Alexander took his army through the Khyber Pass and
overran a number of small states and cities located in the Punjab. But to Alexander’s dismay, his
soldiers refused to go any further, forcing him to turn back. They were exhausted from years of
campaigning far from home and discouraged by news of powerful Indian states to the east. One of
those was the kingdom of Magadha (see Map 3.9).

Magadha’s first capital—Rajagriha—is one of many cities and towns with ruins dating back
to this transitional period. Urban centers were sparse during the Vedic Age but now blossomed,
much like they did during the mature phase of the Harappan Civilization. Similar processes
were at work. As more forests were cleared and marshes drained, the agricultural economy of
the Ganges basin produced ever more surplus food. Population grew, enabling more people to
move into towns and engage in other occupations as craftsmen, artisans, and traders. Kings
encouraged this economic growth as its revenue enriched their treasuries. Caravans of ox-drawn
carts or boats laden with goods travelling from state to state could expect to encounter the king’s
customs officials and pay tolls. So important were rivers to accessing these trade networks that the
Magadhan kings moved their capital to Pataliputra, a port town located on the Ganges (see Map
3.7). Thus, it developed as a hub of both political power and economic exchange. Most towns and
cities began as one or the other, or as places of pilgrimage.
3.8.2 The Caste System
As the population of northern India rose and the landscape was dotted with more villages,
towns, and cities, society became more complex. The social life of a Brahmin priest who served the
king differed from that of a blacksmith who belonged to a town guild, a rich businessman residing
in style in a city, a wealthy property owner, or a poor agricultural laborer living in a village. Thus,
the social identity of each member of society differed.
In ancient India, one measure of identity and the way people imagined their social life and
how they fit together with others was the varna system of four social classes. Another was
caste. Like the varnas, castes were hereditary social classifications; unlike them, they were far
more distinct social groups. The four-fold varna system was more theoretical and important for
establishing clearly who the powerful spiritual and political elites in society were: the Brahmins
and Kshatriya. But others were more conscious of their caste. There were thousands of these,
and each was defined by occupation, residence, marriage, customs, and language. In other
words, because “I” was born into such-and-such a caste, my role in society is to perform this
kind of work. “I” will be largely confined to interacting with and marrying members of this same
group. Our caste members reside in this area, speak this language, hold these beliefs, and are
governed by this assembly of elders. “I” will also be well aware of who belongs to other castes,
and whether or not “I” am of a higher or lower status in relation to them, or more or less pure.
On that basis, “I” may or may not be able, for instance, to dine with them. That is how caste
defined an individual’s life.
The lowest castes were the untouchables. These were peoples who engaged in occupations
considered highly impure, usually because they were associated with taking life; such occupations
include corpse removers, cremators, and sweepers. So those who practiced such occupations
were despised and pushed to the margins of society. Because members of higher castes believed
touching or seeing them was polluting, untouchables were forced to live outside villages and
towns, in separate settlements.

3.8.3 The Challenge to Brahmanism: Buddhism
During this time of transition, some individuals became dissatisfied with life and chose to leave
the everyday world behind. Much like the sages of the Upanishads, these renunciants, as they
were known, were people who chose to renounce social life and material things in order that they
might gain deeper insight into the meaning of life. Some of them altogether rejected Brahmanism
and established their own belief systems. The most renowned example is Siddhartha Gautama
(c. 563 – 480 BCE), who is otherwise known as the Buddha.
Buddha means “Enlightened One” or “Awakened One,” implying that the Buddha was at one
time spiritually asleep but at some point woke up and attained insight into the truth regarding the
human condition. His life story is therefore very important to Buddhists, people who follow the
teachings of the Buddha.
Siddhartha was born a prince, son to the chieftain of Shakya, a clan-based state located at the
foothills of the Himalaya in northern India. His father wished for him to be a ruler like himself,
but Siddhartha went in a different direction. At twenty-nine, after marrying and having a son, he
left home. Legends attribute this departure to his having encountered an old man, a sick man, a
corpse, and a wandering renunciant while out on an excursion. Aging, sickness, and death posed the
question of suffering for Siddhartha, leading him to pursue spiritual insight. For years, he sought
instruction from other wanderers and experimented with their techniques for liberating the self
from suffering through meditation and asceticism. But he failed to obtain the answers he sought.
Then, one day, while seated beneath a tree meditating for an extended period of time, a
deepening calm descended upon Siddhartha, and he experienced nirvana. He also obtained
insight into the reasons for human suffering and what was needful to end it. This insight was
at the heart of his teachings for the remaining forty-five years of his life. During that time, he
travelled around northern India teaching his dharma—his religious ideas and practices—and
gained a following of students.
The principal teaching of the Buddha, presented at his first sermon, is called the Four Noble
Truths. The first is the noble truth of suffering. Based on his own experiences, the Buddha
concluded that life is characterized by suffering not only in an obvious physical and mental sense,
but also because everything that promises pleasure and happiness is ultimately unsatisfactory
and impermanent. The second noble truth states that the origin of suffering is an unquenchable
thirst. People are always thirsting for something more, making for a life of restlessness with no
end in sight. The third noble truth is that there is a cure for this thirst and the suffering it brings:
nirvana. Nirvana means “blowing out,” implying extinction of the thirst and the end of suffering.
No longer striving to quell the restlessness with temporary enjoyments, people can awaken to
“the city of nirvana, the place of highest happiness, peaceful, lovely, without suffering, without
fear, without sickness, free from old age and death.”1
 The fourth noble truth is the Eight-Fold
Path, a set of practices that leads the individual to this liberating knowledge. The Buddha taught
that through a program of study of Buddhist teachings (right understanding, right attitude),
moral conduct (right speech, right action, right livelihood), and meditation (right effort, right
1 Rupert Gethin, The Foundations of Buddhism (Oxford University Press, 1998), 79.
Page | 86
concentration, right mindfulness), anyone could become a Buddha. Everyone has the potential to
awaken, but each must rely on his or her own determination.
After the Buddha died c. 480 BCE, his students established monastic communities known
as the Buddhist sangha. Regardless of their varna or caste, both men and women could choose
to leave home and enter a monastery as a monk or nun. They would shave their heads, wear
ochre-colored robes, and vow to take refuge in the Buddha, dharma, and sangha. Doing so meant
following the example of the Buddha and his teachings on morality and meditation, as well as
living a simple life with like-minded others in pursuit of nirvana and an end to suffering.
3.9 THE MAURYAN EMPIRE (321 – 184 BCE)
The kingdom of Magadha was the most powerful state in India when the Nanda Dynasty
came to power in 364 BCE. Nine Nanda kings made it even greater, by improving methods of tax
collection and administration, funding irrigation projects and canal building, and maintaining an
impressive army of infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots.
But Nanda aspirations were cut short when they were overthrown by Chandragupta
Maurya (r. 321 – 297 BCE), who began a new period in India’s history. He and his son Bindusara
(r. 287 – 273 BCE) and grandson Ashoka (r. 268 – 232 BCE) were destined to forge the first
large empire in India’s
history, one that would
inspire the imagination of
later empire builders in
South Asia. The Mauryan
Empire included most
of the subcontinent and
lasted for 140 years (see
Map 3.10)
Conflicting accounts
make it difficult to say
anything definitive about
the first two kings. Chandragupta may have come
from a Kshatriya (warrior) clan, or a Vaishya
(commoner) clan of peacock-tamers. In his youth,
he spent time in the
northwest, where he encountered Alexander the
Great. With the assistance
of Kautilya, a disloyal

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
Brahmin of the Nanda court, Chandragupta formed alliances with Nanda enemies, overthrowing
them in 321 BCE. Thereafter, through diplomacy and war, he secured control over central and
northern India.
Kautilya, whose advice may have been critical to Chandragupta’s success, is viewed as the
author of the Arthashastra, a treatise on statecraft. This handbook for kings covered in detail
the arts of governing, diplomacy, and warfare. To help ensure centralization of power in the
ruler’s hands, it provided a blueprint of rules and regulations necessary to maintain an efficient
bureaucracy, a detailed penal code, and advice on how to deploy spies and informants.
Chandragupta’s campaigns ended when he concluded a treaty with Seleucus Nicator in 301
BCE. After Alexander the Great retreated from India and then died, a struggle for his empire
broke out among his generals. Seleucus was one of them. He gained control of the eastern half
and sought to reclaim northwest
India. But he was confronted by
Chandragupta, defeated, and
forced to surrender the Indus
Basin and much of Afghanistan,
giving the Mauryan Empire control
over trade routes to West Asia.
The treaty, however, established
friendly relations between the
two rulers, for in exchange for
hundreds of elephants, Seleucus
gave Chandragupta a daughter
in marriage and dispatched an
envoy to his court. Hellenistic
kings (see Chapter 5) maintained
commercial and diplomatic ties
with India.
Military expansion continued
under Bindusara and Ashoka until
all but the tip of the subcontinent
came under the empire’s control.
With King Ashoka, however,
warfare came to an end. We know
far more about him because he
left behind a fascinating record
telling much about his ideas on
governing. He had edicts inscribed
on rocks throughout the realm and
on sandstone pillars erected in the
Ganges heartland (see Map 3.11).

He then placed them in populous areas where people usually gathered, so that his officials could
read them to his largely illiterate subjects.
One rock edict speaks to why King Ashoka decided to renounce violence. While waging war
against a small state located along the east coast, he was deeply disturbed by the amount of
suffering and dislocation the war heaped upon innocent people’s lives. This realization caused
him to redouble his faith in the Buddha. Ashoka, it turns out, was a lay follower of Buddhism.
In his edicts, he proclaimed to his subjects that the sound of the drum would be replaced
by the sound of the dharma. In ancient India, dharma meant universal law. For the Brahmin
priests, for example, dharma meant a society and religious order founded on Vedic principles and
the caste system. For Buddhists, dharma consisted of the truths taught by the Buddha. For kings,
dharma was enlightened governing and just rule. Thus, Ashoka was proclaiming that he would
now rule by virtue, not force.
Ashoka’s kingly dharma was shaped by his personal practice of Buddhism. This dharma
consisted of laws of ethical behavior and right conduct fashioned from Indian traditions of kingship
and his understanding of Buddhist principles. To gain his subject’s willing obedience, he sought to
inspire a sense of gratitude by presenting himself in the role of a father looking out for his children.
He told his subjects that he was appointing officers to tour his realm and attend to the welfare
and happiness of all. Justice was to be impartially administered and medical treatment provided
for animals and humans. A principle of non-injury to all beings was to be observed. Following
this principle meant not only renouncing state violence, but also forbidding slaughtering certain
animals for sacrifices or for cooking in the royal kitchen. Ashoka also proclaimed that he would
replace his pleasure and hunting tours with dharma tours. During these, he promised to give gifts
to Brahmins and the aged and to visit people in the countryside.
In return, Ashoka asked his subjects to observe certain principles. He knew his empire was
pluralistic, consisting of many peoples with different cultures and beliefs. He believed that if
he instilled certain values in these peoples, then his realm might be knit together in peace and
harmony. Thus, in addition to non-injury, Ashoka taught forbearance. He exhorted his subjects
to respect parents, show courtesy to servants, and, more generally, be liberal, compassionate,
and truthful in their treatment of others. These values were also to be embraced by religious
communities, since Ashoka did not want people fighting over matters of faith.
The king’s writ shaped the government because kings were the heart of it. They were advised by
a council of ministers and served by high officials who oversaw the major functions of the state. The
Mauryans were particularly concerned with efficient revenue collection and uniform administration
of justice. To that end, they divided the empire into a hierarchy of provinces and districts and
appointed officials to manage matters at each level. But given such an immense empire spread over
a geographically and ethnically diverse territory, the level of Mauryan control varied. Historians
recognize three broad zones. The first was the metropolitan region—with its capital Pataliputra—
located on the Ganges Plain. This heartland was tightly governed. The second zone consisted of
conquered regions of strategic and economic importance. These provinces were placed under the
control of members of the royal family and senior officials, but state formation was slower. That is,
the tentacles of bureaucracy did not reach as deeply into local communities. Lastly, the third zone 
Page | 89
CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
consisted of hinterlands sparsely populated by tribes of foragers and nomads. Here, state control
was minimal, amounting to little more than establishing workable relations with chieftains.
After King Ashoka’s reign, the Mauryan Empire declined. The precise reasons for this decline
are unknown. Kings enjoyed only brief reigns during the final fifty years of the empire’s existence,
so they may have been weak. Since loyalty to the ruler was one element of the glue that held the
centralized bureaucracy together, weak kings may explain why the political leaders of provinces
pulled away and the empire fragmented into smaller states. Furthermore, the Mauryan court’s
demand for revenue sufficient to sustain the government and a large standing army may have
contributed to discontent. In 184 BCE, the last king was assassinated by his own Brahmin military
commander, and India’s first major imperial power came to an end.
3.10 REGIONAL STATES, TRADE, AND DEVOTIONAL
RELIGION: INDIA 200 BCE – 300 CE
After the Mauryan Empire fell, no one major power held control over a substantial part of India
until the rise of the Gupta Empire in the fourth century CE. Thus, for five hundred years, from c. 200
BCE to 300 CE, India saw a fairly rapid turnover of numerous, competing regional monarchies. Most of
these were small, while the larger ones were only loosely integrated. Some developed along the Ganges.
Others were of Central Asian origins, the product of invasions from the northwest. Also, for the first
time, states formed in southern India. Yet, in spite of the political instability, India was economically
dynamic, as trade within and without the subcontinent flourished, and India was increasingly linked
to other parts of the world in networks of exchange. And new trends appeared in India’s major
religious traditions. A popular,
devotional form of worship
was added to Buddhism
and also became a defining
element of Hinduism.
3.10.1 Regional States
The general who brought
the Mauryan Empire to a close
by a military coup established
the Shunga Dynasty (c. 185 –
73 BCE). Like its predecessor,
this kingdom was centered
on the middle Ganges, the
heartland of India’s history
since the late Vedic Age. But
unlike it, the Shunga Kingdom rapidly dwindled in size.

Shunga rulers were constantly warring with neighboring
kingdoms, and the last fell to an internal coup in 73 CE.
Subsequently, during the ensuing half millennium, other
regions of India played equally prominent roles.
The northwest remained a source of dynamism, as
different peoples living beyond the Hindu Kush invaded
India and established one kingdom after another.
Most of this movement was caused by instability on
the steppe lands of Central Asia, where competing
confederations of nomadic pastoralists fought for
control over territory.
The most powerful among this succession of states
was the Kushan Kingdom, whose origins take us far
away to the north of China. There, in the second century
CE, nomadic groups struggling with scarcity moved west,
displacing another group and forcing them into northern
Afghanistan. Those peoples are known as the Yuezhi
(yew-eh-jer), and they were made up of several tribes. In
the first century CE, a warrior chieftain from one Yuezhi
tribe, the Kushans, united them, invaded northwest
India, and assumed exalted titles befitting a king. His
successor, ruling from Afghanistan,
gained control over the Punjab and
reached into the plains of the upper
Ganges River.
The greatest Kushan ruler, King
Kanishka, furthered what these first
two kings began, forging an empire
extending from Central Asia across
the mountain ranges of Afghanistan
into much of northern India (see
Map 3.12). Ruling the many peoples
of such a sprawling territory required
more than the periodic plundering
campaigns of nomad chieftains. One
sculpture of King Kanishka puts
these Central Asian roots on display
(see Figure 3.8). In it, he is wearing a

both. Kanishka is depicted wearing a crown, beard, long tunic,
trousers, and boots. He is holding a scepter or trident in the
left hand and standing over an altar. Inscriptions recognize
him as “King of kings.” Flames arise from his shoulders. On the
obverse side, the first coin displays the Buddha raising his right
hand, symbolizing reassurance. Other Kushan coins display
Greek, Indian, and Iranian deities.

belted tunic, coat, and felt boots, and carrying a
sword and mace. Kushan gold coins, however,
cast him and his two predecessors in another
light: as universal monarchs (see Figure 3.9). On
one side, the crowned kings are displayed along
with inscriptions bearing titles used by the most
powerful Indian, Persian, Chinese, and Roman
emperors of that time. The obverse side contains
images of both Indian and foreign deities. The
Kushan rulers, it appears, solved the problem
of ruling an extensive, culturally diverse realm
by patronizing the many different gods beloved
by the peoples living within it. Buddhists, for
instance, saw King Kanishka as a great Buddhist
ruler, much like they did King Ashoka. In fact,
Kanishka supported Buddhist scholarship and
encouraged missionaries to take this faith from
India to Central Asia and China. But his coins
also depict Greek, Persian, and Hindu deities,
suggesting that he was open-minded, and
perhaps strategic, in matters of religion.
After Kanishka’s reign, from the mid-second
century CE onwards, the empire declined.
Like the other, larger Indian states during this
time, only a core area was ruled directly by the
king’s servants. The other areas were governed
indirectly by establishing tributary relations with
local rulers. As Kushan power waned, numerous smaller polities emerged, turning northern and
central India into a mosaic of states.
The Indian peninsula—the territory south of the Indo-Gangetic Plain and the Vindhya
Mountain Range—also features more prominently after the fall of the Mauryan Empire. In the
south, kingdoms emerged for the first time. The largest was the Satavahana Kingdom, which
included most of the Deccan Plateau and lasted about three centuries. The first rulers were
former Mauryan officials who capitalized on its dissolution, established their own state, and
expanded to the north (see Map 3.13). To establish their legitimacy, Satavahana kings embraced
Aryan civilization by allowing Brahmins to perform sacrifices at the court and by upholding the
varna social order. They also prospered from a rich agricultural base and trade. However, like
so many of the larger states during these centuries, this kingdom was only loosely integrated,
consisting of small provinces governed by civil and military officers and allied, subordinate
chieftains and kings.

3.10.2 Economic Growth and Flourishing Trade Networks
Gold coins discovered in Kushan territory provide much information about the rulers who
issued them. The Satavahanas also minted coins. Additionally, Roman gold coins have been found
at over 130 sites in south India. These were issued by Roman emperors at the turn of the Christian
era, during the first century CE. These coins serve as a sign of the times. Indian monarchs issued
coins because trade was growing and intensifying all around them and they wished to support and
profit from it. Expanding the money supply facilitated trade and was one way to achieve that goal.
Both Indian kingdoms were also geographically well positioned to take advantage of emerging
global trade networks linking the subcontinent to other regions of Afro-Eurasia. This advantage
provides one reason why they flourished.
The expansion of trade both within and without India is a major theme of these five centuries.
Put simply, South Asia was a crossroads with much to offer. In market towns and cities across the
subcontinent, artisans and merchants organized to produce and distribute a wide variety of goods.
Guilds were their principal method of organization. A guild was a professional association made
up of members with a particular trade. Artisan guilds—such as weavers and goldsmiths—set the
prices and ensured the quality of goods. Operating like and sometimes overlapping with castes,
guilds also set rules for members and policed their behavior. They acted collectively as proud
participants of urban communities, displaying their banners in festive processions and donating
money to religious institutions. Merchant guilds then saw to it that their artisan products were
transported along routes traversing the subcontinent or leading beyond to foreign lands.
The lands and peoples surrounding India, and the many empires they lived under, are the
topic of later chapters, but we can take a snapshot of the scene here (see Map 3.14). In the first
century CE, India sat amidst
trade networks connecting the
Roman Empire, Persian Empire
(Parthian), Chinese Empire, and
a host of smaller kingdoms and
states in Africa, Central Asia, and
Southeast Asia. The major trade
networks were the Silk Roads and
the Indian Ocean maritime trade
routes. Thus, for example, GrecoRoman traders plied the waters
of the Arabian Sea, bringing ships
filled with amphorae and gold
coins to ports located along the
west coast of India, and returning
with spices, textiles, and gems.
Indian traders sailed the waters of
the Bay of Bengal, bringing cloth

and beads from the Coromandel Coast to Southeast Asia and returning with cinnamon cloves
and sandalwood. In the northwest, a similar trade in a variety of goods took place along the Silk
Roads. Indian traders, for instance, took advantage of the excellent position of the Kushan Empire
to bring silk from Central Asia to the ports of northwest India, from where it could then be sent
on to Rome. In sum, this vibrant international trade constituted an early stage of globalization.
Combined with regional trade across the subcontinent, India saw an increase in travel in all
directions, even as it remained divided among many regional kingdoms.
3.10.3 Religious Transformations: Buddhism and Hinduism into the
Common Era
Aside from expanding trade, another theme during these centuries of political division is
transformations in two of India’s major religions traditions: Buddhism and Hinduism. In both
cases, new religious ideas and practices were added that emphasized the importance of devotion
and appealed to broader groups of people.
Buddhism thrived after the Buddha died in c. 480 BCE, all the more so during this period of
regional states and the early centuries of the Common Era, at the very moment Christianity was
spreading through the Roman Empire. In fact, it would not be exaggeration to say that Buddhism
was the dominant public religion. The communities of monks and nuns (sangha) that formed after
Buddha’s time lived in monasteries built along trade routes, near towns, or in caves. To build these
and survive, the sangha needed much support, which often came in the form of royal patronage.
Kings such as Ashoka and Kanishka, for example, offered lavish support for Buddhist institutions.
But over time, the contributions of merchants, women, and people from lower varnas became
just as important. Unlike Vedic Brahmanism, which privileges the Brahmin varna, Buddhism was
more inclusive and less concerned with birth and social class. After all, in theory, anyone could
become a Buddha.
Buddhism also emphasized the importance of attaining good karma for better rebirths and a
future enlightenment; one didn’t need to be a monk to work at this. Rather, any ordinary layperson,
regardless of their religious beliefs, could also take Buddhist vows and practice Buddhist ways.
That meant not only leading a moral life but also supporting the sangha. By so doing, the good
karma of the monks and nuns would be transferred to the community and oneself. This practice
served to not only make the world a better place and to ensure a better future, but also to allow
opportunities for publicly displaying one’s piety. That is why kings, rich merchants, and ordinary
people donated to the sangha and gave monks food.
With so much support and participation, Buddhism also changed. Every major world religion
has different branches. Christianity, for example, has three major ones: the Roman Catholic,
Eastern Orthodox, and Protestant churches. These branches share a common root but diverge in
some matters of belief and practice. Buddhism has two major branches: Theravada and Mahayana
Buddhism. Theravada Buddhism is early Buddhism, the Buddhism of the early sangha, and
is based on the earliest records of the Buddha’s teaching of the Four Noble Truths. A practitioner
of this form of Buddhism sought to end suffering and attain nirvana by engaging the Eight-Fold 
Page | 94
Path, a program of study, moral conduct, and meditation. Ideally, the practitioner pursued this
program as a monk or nun in a monastic setting, and eventually became an “arhat,” that is, a
perfected person who is nearly or fully enlightened.
Mahayana Buddhism came later, during the early centuries of the Common Era. Mahayana
means “Great Vehicle,” pointing to the fact that this form of Buddhism offers multiple paths to
enlightenment for people from all walks of life. This branch has no single founder and consists of
a set of ideas elaborated upon in new Buddhist scriptures dating to this time. In one of these new
paths, the Buddha becomes a god who can be worshipped, and by anyone. A monk or lay follower
is welcome to make an offering before an image of the Buddha placed in a shrine. By so doing, they
demonstrate their desire to end suffering and seek salvation through faith in the Buddha.
Furthermore, with the “Great Vehicle,” the universe becomes populated with numerous
Buddhas. Practitioners developed the idea that if anyone can become a Buddha over the
course of many lifetimes of practice, then other Buddhas must exist. Also, the belief arose that
some individuals had tread the path to Buddhahood but chose to forego a final enlightenment
where they would leave the world behind so that they could, out of great compassion for all
suffering people, work for their deliverance. These holy beings are known as Bodhisattvas, that
is, enlightened persons who seek nirvana solely out of their desire to benefit all humanity.
Buddhists also believed that the universe consisted of multiple worlds with multiple heavenly
realms. Some of these Buddhas and Bodhisattvas created their own heavenly realms and, from
there, offer grace to those seeking salvation through them. Through veneration and worship,
the follower hopes to be reborn in that heavenly realm, where they can then finish the path to
liberation. Seeking to become a Bodhisattva through a path of devotion was one of the new paths
outlined by Mahayana scriptures.
Buddhism traveled out of India and had an impact on other parts of the world, making it
a major world religion. This expansion resulted from the efforts of Buddhist missionaries and
merchants, as well as kings who supported its propagation. Theravada Buddhism was carried to
Sri Lanka and parts of Southeast Asia, where it remains a dominant religious tradition. Mahayana
Buddhism spread to Central and East Asia, a process that was facilitated by the Silk Road and
the support of kings like Kanishka of the Kushan Empire (see Map 3.15). However, Buddhism
eventually declined in India, especially after the first millennium BCE. From that time, Hinduism
and Islam increasingly won over the religious imagination of the peoples of India, with royal
patronage and lay support following.
Hinduism also saw new developments during this period and throughout the first millennium
CE. In fact, many scholars see these centuries as the time during which Hinduism first took shape
and prefer using the term Vedic Brahmanism for the prior history of this religious tradition.
Vedic Brahmanism was the sacrifice-centered religion of the Vedas where, in exchange for gifts,
Brahmins performed rituals for kings and householders in order to ensure the favor of the gods.
It also included the speculative world of the Upanishads, where renunciants went out in search of
spiritual liberation.
But something important happened during these later centuries. An additional religious
literature was compiled and shrines and temples with images of deities were constructed, pointing 
Page | 95
CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
to the emergence of new, popular forms of devotion and an effort to define a good life and society
according to the idea of dharma. With this transition, we can speak more formally of Hinduism.
One important set of texts is the Dharma Scriptures, ethical and legal works whose
authority derived from their attribution to ancient sages. Dharma means “duty” or proper human
conduct and so, true to their title, these scriptures define the rules each person must follow in
order to lead a righteous and devout life and contribute to a good society. Most importantly,

pathway for the spread of Theravada Buddhism, from India (including Sri Lanka) to Southeast Asia. The red arrows
indicate the routes for the spread of Mahayana Buddhism to East Asia (China, Korea, and Japan).

these rules were determined by the
role assigned to an individual by the
varna system of social classes, the
caste system, and gender. For example,
for a male, dharma meant following
the rules for their caste and varna
while passing through four stages in
life: student, householder, hermit, and
renunciant. In his youth, a man must
study to prepare for his occupation
and, as a householder, he must support
his family and contribute to society.
Late in life, after achieving these goals,
he should renounce material desires
and withdraw from society, first living
as a hermit on the margins of society
and then as a wandering renunciant
whose sole devotion is to god.
A woman’s roles, on the other hand,
were defined as obedience to her father
in youth and faithful service to her husband as an adult. For this reason, historians see a trend
in ancient Indian history whereby women became increasingly subservient and subordinate.
Although women were to be honored and supported, the ideal society and family were defined in
patriarchal terms. That meant men dominated public life, were the authority figures at home, and
usually inherited the property. Also, women were increasingly expected to marry at a very young
age—even prior to puberty—and to remain celibate as widows. In later centuries, some widows
even observed the practice of burning themselves upon the funeral pyre of the deceased husband.
Famous Indian epics also illustrated the theme of duty. The Ramayana (“Rama’s Journey”)
tells the story of Prince Rama and his wife Sita. Rama’s parents—the king and queen—wished for
him to take the throne, but a second queen plotted against him and forced him into exile for years.
Sita accompanied him, but was abducted by a demon-king, leading to a battle in consequence. With
the help of a loyal monkey god, Rama defeated the demon, recovered his wife, and returned with
her to his father’s kingdom, where they were crowned king and queen. In brief, throughout this
long story, Rama exemplified the virtues of a king and Sita exemplified the virtues of a daughter
and wife. They both followed their dharma.
A similar theme dominates the Bhagavad-Gita (“Song of the Lord”). This classic of Hindu
scripture is included as a chapter in another Indian epic, the Mahabharata (The Great Bharata).
It tells of wars between cousins who are fighting over the title to their kingdom’s throne. As a
battle was poised to commence, one of these cousins—Prince Arjuna—threw down his weapons
and refused to fight because he did not wish to harm his kinsmen. But Krishna, his mentor and
charioteer, delivered a speech on the nature of duty for a warrior like himself, one that illustrated

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
the religious basis for observing
dharma. Arjuna was thus moved
to action.
Religious texts and temples
also signal the rise of a powerful
devotional Hinduism centered
upon a few supreme deities.
Stone temples were erected
for the purpose of housing
representations of a god or
goddess (see Figure 3.10).
Peoples of all classes could go
to the temple to view the deity,
pray, and offer fruits and flowers.
By so doing, they showed their
love for this lord and their desire
to be saved by his or her grace.
The most popular deities were
Shiva and Vishnu.
Growing up, devotees of
these supreme deities would hear countless myths and legends about their origins, exploits, and
powers from Brahmins at the temples or story-tellers in their hometown. Vishnu preserves the
universe and watches over it; in times of unbridled evil, he assumes the form of an avatar to
remove it and return the world to righteousness. King Rama of the Ramayana and Krishna of
the Bhagavad-Gita are in fact two such incarnations of Vishnu. Shiva is both benevolent and
protective but also destroys all things. Whereas Vishnu preserves the universe, Shiva destroys
it at the end of a cycle. A third deity, Brahma, then recreates it. Combined, this Hindu trinity—
Brahma the creator, Vishnu the preserver, and Shiva the destroyer—represent different facets of
the one divine reality behind the great cosmic cycles and also life and death. They each have female
counterparts. Shiva’s wife Parvati, for instance, is a goddess of love and devotion (see Figure 3.11).
In sum, during this period and the first millennium CE, several elements come together to
make up the religion outsiders later labeled Hinduism. These elements include the sacrificial
religion of the Brahmins, the renunciants’ spiritual pursuit of Self and divine reality (atman and
brahman), a social order shaped by the varna and caste system, notions of law and duty embodied
in each individual’s dharma, and devotion to supreme deities and their avatars. Hinduism thus
thoroughly shaped the social and spiritual life of the peoples of India and of Indian society.
Therefore, the rulers of ancient India supported the Brahmins, built temples, upheld the varna
system, and assumed titles declaring their devotion to the supreme deities. Hinduism became
part of the king’s dharma, and fulfilling that dharma brought the approval of his subjects.

3.11 THE GUPTA EMPIRE
AND INDIA’S CLASSICAL
AGE (300 – 600 CE)
The pattern of regional states
characteristic of post-Mauryan times and
the early centuries of the Common Era
will persist in India until the sixteenth
century. At any one time, India had many
kings. But on occasion, one king might
forge a substantial regional power and
assume grand titles that elevated him
over others. The political scene, therefore,
consisted of not only a mosaic of royal
powers but also a political hierarchy.
Some rulers held power over others,
making for a pattern of paramountcy and
subordination among kings and princes
of many different dynasties across the
land. These paramount powers could
then take advantage of the stability they
established and the wealth they accrued to
patronize the arts and promote a cultural
renaissance. The Gupta Empire is the
pre-eminent example of such a power
during the period 300 – 600 CE; indeed,
some historians see the time during which they dominated northern India as a classical age.
As is the case for so much of India’s ancient political history, details concerning Gupta
rulers have been reconstructed largely from coins, inscriptions, and seals. The dynasty begins in
obscurity with two kings of a minor state located along the Ganges River, but then explodes on
the scene with the next two kings: Chandragupta I (c. 320 – 335) and his son Samudragupta
(c. 335 – 375). Through conquest and marital alliances, Chandragupta I forged a larger empire in
the old Ganges heartland (see Map 3.16). A gold coin provides some of the evidence detailing the
Gupta Empire. This coin displays Chandragupta standing next to a certain Queen Kumaradevi.
He has taken the title “Great King of Kings,” which signifies imperial power, while she is identified
as the princess of a powerful neighboring kingdom (see Figure 3.12).
During his forty-year reign, Samudragupta made the empire great, a feat most forcefully
evidenced by a royal eulogy inscribed on one of the old edict pillars of King Ashoka. This eulogy,
which describes Samudragupta as “conqueror of the four corners of the earth,” tells of how
he subdued dozens of kings across the subcontinent. Closer to home, along the Ganges, many
Map 3.16 | The Gupta Empire in the third and fourth

the reign of Samudragupta, although many local rulers
were left in place as subordinate kings.

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
rulers were slain and their territory was annexed,
while farther out across northern India and to the
southeast, others were “captured and liberated.”
These captured and liberated kings were recognized
as “servants,” which meant they could continue
to rule their own lands as subordinates, on the
condition that they paid tribute and homage. Gupta
rulers thus directly administered a core territory
along the Ganges River while adopting a model of
tributary overlordship for the rest. The Gupta
imperial court in effect presided over a society of
tributary rulers.
After Samudragupta’s time, two more Gupta
rulers enjoyed long reigns of forty years, with the
empire reaching a peak of power and prosperity.
But in the sixth century, decline set in. A series
of weaker rulers faced internal dissension
at home and foreign invasion from abroad.
A great nomadic power known as the Huns
emerged out of Central Asia and invaded
the northwest, destabilizing Gupta rule.
Subordinate rulers then began to break away,
and smaller kingdoms replaced the empire.
After the sixth century, India entered a new
stage in its history.
But there is more to these centuries
than high politics. Again, the Gupta era is
often labeled as a classical age for India. A
period in the history of a civilization’s being
labeled as classical generally means it was a
time of artistic and intellectual excellence,
with its having attained standard-setting
achievements in a number of fields. Classical
also suggests a certain level of maturation for a
civilization. It should be noted, however, that
some scholars question the use of this term

because all ages produce great works, and sometimes choosing one period as classical simply
represents the biased judgment of a later time.
Yet, during the Gupta era, India did produce important scientific discoveries and works of
art and literature. The exquisite sculptures of the Buddha portraying his serene enlightenment
and teaching were the epitome of the classical achievement in art (see Figure 3.13). India also
saw an outpouring of literary masterpieces. Kalidasa is one of India’s greatest Sanskrit poets
and playwrights. His play The Recognition of Shakuntala, a world masterpiece, tells the story
of a girl who lived in a hermitage in the countryside after being abandoned by her parents. One
day, a king was out hunting and chanced upon her. They fell in love and married. But then he
hurried back to his palace and when she later came to him he no longer knew her because he
had been cursed. The only solution for her dilemma was for her to present a ring he had left her.
Unfortunately, it had slipped off her finger. The play tells of how this love story concluded, along
with the involvement of many higher powers.
In the field of medicine, Ayurveda matured as more complete editions of ancient medical
texts were compiled. Ayurveda (meaning “knowledge for longevity”) is India’s ancient medical
science. It provides a systematic effort to explain the origins of diseases in dislocations of bodily
humors (substances) and to prescribe cures for them. India also saw advancements in the
fields of astronomy and mathematics. Aryabhata (476 – 550 CE), for instance, was the first
astronomer to propose that the earth rotated on an axis and a scientific explanation for eclipses.
He calculated pi to 3.1416 and the solar year to 364.3586805 days. His work demonstrates the
contemporary use of a sophisticated system of decimal notation, which was also an ancient
Indian discovery.
3.12 INDIA’S EARLY MEDIEVAL AGE AND THE DEVELOPMENT
OF ISLAMIC STATES IN INDIA, 600 – 1300
The history of ancient India concludes with the decline of the Gupta Empire. The next major
period, which lasts for roughly seven centuries (c. 600 – 1300), is the early medieval age. During
these centuries, kingdoms in both the north and south proliferated and regularly turned over.
Therefore, at any one time, India was fragmented by numerous regional kingdoms. As the rulers of
these warred and formed alliances, they employed the system of paramountcy and subordination
begun during the Gupta era, with some rulers being overlords and others vassals. Also, successful
rulers demonstrated their power by granting land to officers, Brahmins, and temples. The outcome
was a political pattern labeled Indian feudalism.
These rulers also demonstrated their power—and enhanced it—by patronizing Hindu institutions
and developing local traditions in the regions where their courts resided. They adopted titles showing
their devotion to the great Hindu deities, declared their intent to uphold dharma, built fabulous
Hindu temples in urban centers, and charged Brahmins with attending to them and serving at their
courts. One outstanding example of a feudal kingdom is the Chola Kingdom of southern India.
Lastly, at the end of this age, a new force appeared on the Indian scene. Muslim Arab and
Turkic rulers of West and Central Asia made incursions into the subcontinent. Along with Arab 
Page | 101
CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
traders arriving on India’s west coast for trade, they brought a new religion and type of rule to the
landscape of early medieval India and forged new connections between the subcontinent and the
rest of Afro-Eurasia.
3.12.1 Indian Feudalism
Feudalism is a term historians first used to describe the political, social, and economic system
of the European Middle Ages (see Chapter Twelve). That system was the world of lords, vassal
knights, and serfs characteristic of Europe from the tenth to thirteenth centuries. In exchange
for homage and military service, vassals received land from their lords. These lands became their
manors, and serfs worked them. The lords and their vassals constituted a privileged nobility,
while the serfs lived in a state of servitude.
Historians also use feudalism to describe India during the early medieval age. But the
usefulness of this term is much debated, because conditions on the ground varied from place
to place, not only in Europe but also in India. Therefore, historians now only use the term in a
general sense while also describing specific variations. In general, feudalism designates a political
and economic scene characterized by fragmented authority, a set of obligations between lords
and vassals, and grants of land (including those who work it) by rulers in exchange for some kind
of service.
Authority on the early medieval Indian subcontinent was indeed fragmented, not only by
the many regional kingdoms that existed at any one time but also, more importantly, within
kingdoms. Because kingdoms incessantly warred with one another, their boundaries were fluid.
Rulers usually closely administered a core area near the capital with a civil administration,
while granting feudatories on the periphery. Having defeated the ruling lineage of a powerful
neighboring state—such as a king, prince, or chief, victorious kings might allow them to retain
noble titles and their lands, on the condition that they demonstrate allegiance to him and even
supply tribute and military service. The overlord could then wield the title “Great King of Kings,”
while the lesser rulers bore titles signifying their status as subordinate rulers who do obeisance.
Additionally, aside from granting these feudatories, medieval rulers also issued land grants to
important persons and institutions in their realms, such as Brahmins, high officials, or temples. As
opposed to receiving a cash salary, these recipients were permitted to retain revenue from villages
on this land, as well as to exercise some level of judicial authority. Brahmins were so important to
kings because they aided him in upholding the king’s dharma. The king’s duty was to protect the
people, uphold the varna social order, sacrifice to the traditional Vedic deities, and show devotion
to Shiva or Vishnu. As the religious leaders and intellectuals in the community, and the most
prestigious varna, Brahmins could craft genealogies proving a king’s illustrious origins in the
heroic lineages of the epic stories of ancient times, perform the sacrifices, and maintain temples.
So rulers often generously gifted land to them or to the magnificent temple complexes rulers built.
Medieval India, then, consisted of a multitude of kingdoms, each of which governed a part
of their realms through feudal arrangements, by granting feudatories and issuing land grants to
nobility or prestigious religious and political leaders, in exchange for allegiance and assisting the 
Page | 102
ruler in demonstrating his being worthy of his sacred role. In most instances, given that society
was patriarchal, rulers were male, but in many cases queens inherited the throne. Rudramadevi,
for instance, was chosen by her father
to accede to the throne of a kingdom
in central India, likely because he had
no sons or living brothers. Inscriptions
refer to her as a king; indeed, she is
said to have donned male attire while
leading soldiers into battle. She is
also portrayed seated on a lion, with a
dagger and shield in hand. Thus, she
was conformed to the expected role of a
warrior, male king. Clearly, preserving
the dynastic line was more important
than biological sex.
3.12.2 The Chola Dynasty
The Chola Kingdom illustrates
well the grandeur of powerful regional
states during the early medieval period.
South India first came to prominence
with the rise of the Satavahana
Kingdom in the Deccan Plateau (c.
the second century BCE). But even at
that time, in the fertile hinterlands and
along the seaboard of the southern tip
of the subcontinent, Tamil states were forming. Tamil refers to the regional language spoken and
written by Indian peoples of the far south, as well as to their local customs and culture. Powerful
Tamil lineages divided up Tamil land among chiefdoms, and, over time, some evolved into small
but impressive kingdoms. These Tamil states also adopted elements of the Aryan culture of the
north, including the use of Sanskrit, the varna social system, Vedic Brahmanism, and the Hindu
cults of Shiva and Vishnu.
The Cholas, for instance, date back to Satavahana times, but they don’t become significant
for India’s political history until the ninth century CE, when they show up as a feudatory of a
neighboring Tamil kingdom. Beginning with King Aditya I (r. 871 – 907), the Cholas began a process
of expansion that would eventually make it the most powerful kingdom of the south up until the
thirteenth century (see Map 3.17). Two of the most powerful Chola rulers were Rajaraja I (r. 985 –
1012) and his son Rajendra I (1012 – 1044). During their reigns, most of south India was conquered,
including Sri Lanka, and a royal administration was built. Chola kings directly administered a
core area of provinces and districts with royal officials, but also granted feudatories to allegiant

chieftains and land grants to
Brahmins. At the local level,
these authorities worked
with village assemblies and
town associations, both of
which were remarkable for
the level of freedom they had
to manage local affairs.
The Chola kings proved
their greatness through not
only the success of their imperial ambitions but also the
temples they built. These
temples, some of the most
impressive structures in India, testify to the kings’ piety.
Eulogies to Chola kings describe them not only as great
warriors and conquerors
but also as protectors of the
dharma, destroyers of evil,
and generous givers of gifts. Because they were built in honor of the great Hindu deities, temples
put those latter qualities on display. In 1010 CE, Rajaraja I completed the Brihadeshwara Temple
in Tanjavur, the Chola capital and ceremonial center (see Figure 3.14). Atop the main sanctuary
stands a sixty-two meter tall tower carved out of a block of granite weighing eighty-one tons. Numerous representations portray the supreme lord Shiva in his various manifestations, including
one located in the inner sanctuary. On the profusely ornamented tower, Shiva appears repeatedly
in his form as destroyer of the cities of demons. Clearly, Rajaraja I wished to raise the cult of Shiva
to a pre-eminent position in his kingdom, and built this temple to project Chola power.
Like other great regional powers with their unique histories and architectural traditions during
the early medieval period, the Chola kingdom peaked for about two centuries and then declined.
In the thirteenth century, neighboring kingdoms nibbled away at its power and it came to an end.
3.12.3 The Rise of Islamic States in North India
One of the most important developments during India’s early medieval age is the arrival
of Muslim Arab and Turkic traders and conquerors and the eventual establishment of Islamic
states and communities in India. This story begins with the life of Muhammad (570 – 632 CE),
the Prophet of Islam, whose revelations were recorded in the Quran (see Chapter 8). During his
lifetime and after, an Arab community and state governed by the principles of Islam were founded
in Arabia. Over the course of the seventh and eighth centuries, this Arab Islamic state grew into

an empire that included much of West Asia and North Africa. This size meant that many different
ethnic groups—Egyptians, Persians, and Turks, for instance—fell under its governing umbrella.
The ruler of this empire was the caliph, a man designated political successor to Muhammad,
as the leader of the Islamic community. The caliph’s government is called the caliphate. The first
caliphs were friends and relatives of Muhammad, but eventually long-lasting dynasties formed
that made the position hereditary. The first was the Umayyad Dynasty (661 – 750 CE) and the
second the Abbasid Dynasty (750 – 1258 CE). It was during these caliphates that Islam and
Islamic rule made their way into India.
During the Umayyad Caliphate, systematic reconnaissance of the northwest coast of India was
undertaken because conquests brought the empire just to the west of the Indian subcontinent.
When pirates plundered an Arab vessel at the mouth of the Indus River, the caliph authorized
punitive measures, and Umayyad rulers sent an invasion force. In 711, the Sindh (the lower Indus)
was seized from a Hindu ruler and incorporated into the Islamic Empire. An Islamic community
then began to set roots in this part of India.

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
The Umayyad Caliphate ruled from 661 – 750 CE. Note the inclusion of part of northwest
India, near the Indus River. The next major event didn’t transpire until the tenth century, at a
time when Turkic peoples had become important to the history of Islamic states in India. By this
time, the Abbasid Dynasty had replaced the Umayyad as the caliphs of the Islamic Empire. One
method Abbasid rulers used to govern their large realm was to employ enslaved Turks as soldiers
and administrators. Today, the word Turkic might normally be associated with the country of
Turkey, but in fact Turkic peoples and their language family—Turkish—originated in Central Asia.
That is where the expanding Islamic empire first encountered and began incorporating Turks into
their governing.
The significance of these Turkic slave soldiers for India is that the Abbasids employed them as
governors of the eastern end of their empire. This end included parts of Afghanistan, the neighbor
to northwest India. In the tenth century, however, the caliphate was falling apart, and Turkic
military governors took advantage of this dissolution by establishing an independent state in
Afghanistan. The family that did so was the Ghaznavids. Ruling from a fortress in Ghazna, the
Ghaznavids forged an empire that included much of Iran and northwest India (see Map 3.19).

The Ghaznavid ruler who first made forays into India was Mahmud of Ghazna (971 – 1030). In
some historical writing, Mahmud has been portrayed as a brutal plunderer who descended on India
seventeen times with hordes of Turkic cavalry, shocking wealthy cities of the north with the sword of
Islam by destroying their Hindu temples and returning to his capital with their stolen wealth.
But the reality may have been otherwise. Recent work suggests that Mahmud was neither
interested in spreading Islam nor caused massive destruction. Rather, northwestern India had
always been closely linked to Central Asia, as well as being the location of both repeated invasions
and kingdoms that crossed over into the mountains. Furthermore, by the tenth century, Muslim
communities had already become a part of the Indian scene, along the west coast and in this
region. Therefore, Mahmud’s incursions were hardly something new. Nor were his motives.
In medieval India, kings often waged war not only for revenue but also because such was their
custom. Mahmud was likely no different. His empire was experiencing instability; he therefore
sought to prove his mettle as a warrior ruler and to secure his legacy by using Indian wealth to
build palaces and mosques in Ghazna.
Ghaznavid control over India didn’t extend much beyond the Punjab, lasting less than two
centuries. In 1186, Muhammad of Ghur—chieftain of a minor hill state in Afghanistan that was
subordinate to the Ghaznavids—overthrew his overlords in Ghazna and proceeded to forge his
own empire. Desiring to extend it across northern India, he found that his greatest foes were the
Rajputs. The Rajputs were clans located in northern and central India that claimed descent from
renowned Kshatriya (warrior) lineages of ancient times. While Muhammad of Ghuri was planning
his military expeditions, the Rajputs were governing several regional Hindu kingdoms from large
fortresses they had built. In 1192, Muhammad’s forces defeated a confederation of Rajput rulers at
the Battle of Tarain. His slave general and commander-in-chief, Qutb-ud-din Aybak, then achieved
a string of victories across northern India, making it a part of the Ghurid Empire.
Muhammad of Ghur returned to his Afghan homeland, leaving northern India to Aybak, who
then proceeded to set up his headquarters in Delhi, one of the most important cities in South Asia,
and also the capital of today’s nation of India. When Muhammad died in 1206, Aybak took control
of these Indian possessions and established a state of his own called the Delhi Sultanate (see
map 3.20). A sultanate is the government of a sultan, and a sultan is an Islamic ruler who governs
a country largely independently of the caliphs, but without claiming their title. The Delhi sultans,
then, were the sovereign rulers of the first major Muslim state in India, one that would last for
three hundred years.
Looking ahead to our own time, the nation of India today is both culturally and religiously
diverse. Approximately 80% of the population practices Hinduism while 15% practices Islam,
making these the two largest religious traditions in India today. For this reason, relations between
peoples adhering to these two different faiths have been an important issue in the history of South
Asia. As we have seen, the history of Islam and Islamic communities in the subcontinent begins
during the early medieval period. Therefore, historians pay close attention to how Delhi sultans
governed an overwhelmingly Hindu population, as well as how Islamic communities fit into it.
Ruling as they were over an ancient and vast agrarian civilization, the Turkic sultans worked
out an accommodation with India, adapting to the pattern of Indian feudalism. Outside the highest 
Page | 107
CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
levels of government, Hindu society and its traditional leaders were largely left in place, so long
as tax revenue was submitted. With a long history of conquest behind them, Islamic rulers had
learned the benefits of adopting a pragmatic approach to non-Muslims, and these sultans were no
exception. They had little interest in forcibly converting people to the faith, and rather adopted
a principle from the Quran whereby non-Muslim peoples with a scriptural tradition of their own
can live amidst the Islamic community and state so long as they pay a higher tax. At the highest
levels, however, sultans placed Turkic military nobility and educated Persians in charge, often
compensating them with land grants. In fact, because Persians became so important to Sultanate
administration, Persian was adopted as the language of government.
This Muslim ruling elite attempted to retain their Turkic and Persian traditions, but also
slowly adopted Indian customs in what was generally a tolerant atmosphere. At the lower levels
of society, Muslim traders and artisans became an important presence in Indian towns and cities,
as did Indian converts who saw an advantage to converting to this faith. Thus, Hindu and Muslim
communities increasingly interacted with each other during the early medieval age, adopting
elements of each other’s way of life. For that reason, historians speak of a fusion of Islamic and
Indian culture.
3.13 CONCLUSION
We have now passed through the long course of India’s ancient and early medieval history.
We began with the onset of India’s Neolithic period in the seventh millennium BCE and saw how

India’s first civilization—the Harappan Civilization (2600 – 1700 BCE)—emerged from it in the
northwestern region of the subcontinent during the third millennium BCE.
We then examined the long course of the Vedic Age (1700 – 600 BCE). As Harappan
Civilization declined, Indo-Aryans migrated from Central Asia into northern India, bringing
with them their Vedic religion, Sanskrit language, and pastoral and farming way of life. As they
settled down on the Indo-Gangetic Plains and interacted with indigenous peoples, new political,
social, and religious institutions formed. Over the course of several centuries, Aryan clan and
tribal organization developed into kingdoms and oligarchies. Also, a simpler society composed of
priests, warriors, and commoners evolved into a more complex society organized by varnas, the
system of four hereditary social classes. Finally, the Vedic religion of the Brahmin priests evolved
into Brahmanism, the earliest stage in the development of Hinduism.
Next, we surveyed a transitional period in India’s history that began in the sixth century
and lasted until 321 BCE. Sixteen major kingdoms and oligarchies with roots in the late Vedic
Age fought for control over territory in northern India. The kingdom of Magadha dominated.
Accompanying this time of warring states, India entered a second stage of urbanization, as towns
and cities became a prominent feature of the north. Alongside the varnas, the caste system began
to form, organizing Indian society into a much larger number of social groups based on occupation,
residence, language, and religious beliefs. Lastly, new religious ideas were put forward by the
Buddha (c. 563 – 480 BCE) to challenge the dominance of Brahmanism, and Buddhist monastic
communities began to form.
This transitional period ended when Chandragupta Maurya overthrew the last Magadhan
dynasty in 321 BCE and established the Mauryan Empire (321 – 184 BCE). He and his successors
built the first Indian state that included most of the subcontinent. Chandragupta’s grandson,
King Ashoka (r. 268 – 232), is famed for having tried to rule this large realm according to
Buddhist principles.
We then saw how, for five centuries after the fall of the Mauryan Empire (c. 200 BCE – 300
CE), no one major power ruled India. The entire subcontinent saw instead a fairly rapid turnover
of regional monarchies. Some developed along the Ganges River, while others, such as the Kushan
Kingdom, were of Central Asian origins. Also, states such as the Satavahana Kingdom formed in
southern India. Yet, in spite of the political instability, India was economically dynamic, as trade
within and without the subcontinent flourished, and India was increasingly linked to other parts
of the world in such networks of exchange as the Silk Road and Indian Ocean maritime trade.
Lastly, new trends appeared in Buddhism and Hinduism, most notably a popular, devotional
form of worship.
Although India remained a mosaic of states during the period 300 – 600 BCE, historians
recognize this time as distinct because the Gupta Empire (320 – 550 CE) included much of
northern India and facets of Gupta period society and culture suggest that Indian civilization had
matured and entered a classical age. One facet was individual achievements in literature, the arts,
and sciences. But equally as important, the lives of all members of society were now being shaped
and given meaning by a political pattern, social institutions, religious traditions, and a culture
with a deep history. That political pattern included, for example, notions of kingship and the

CHAPTER 3: ANCIENT AND EARLY MEDIEVAL INDIA
king’s dharma, as well as political hierarchy. Social institutions included the patriarchal family,
varna and caste, and commercial associations in cities and towns. As for religious traditions, we
have focused on the development of Hinduism and Buddhism and how they shaped the religious
landscape with their long literary and scriptural traditions, notions of dharma, and monastic and
temple life.
We ended this chapter by introducing early medieval India (c. 600 – 1300 BCE). The political
scene remained one of powerful regional states, each with their unique local histories and traditions.
The methods by which kings established relations with neighboring rulers and within their own
lands has been described as Indian feudalism. Some kings, like the Cholas, buttressed their power
by claiming to rule according to Hindu notions of dharma, by, for instance, building large Hindu
temples and patronizing the Brahmins. Finally, during these centuries, Islamic rule, communities,
and religion entered the South Asian landscape, changing the course of India’s history.

China’s early historical development long predated Japan’s and Korea’s, which is why a chapter
on East Asian history logically begins in the second millennium BCE with China’s first dynasty.
However, today’s nation of China is much larger than China was in ancient times. In earlier times,
the bulk of the Chinese population lived in China proper, by which we mean the historical
heartland of ancient China (see Map 4.1). To the east, China proper is bounded by the Yellow Sea,

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
East China Sea, and South China Sea.
To the south, it is bordered by the
mountainous jungles of Southeast
Asia. To the west and north, China
is rimmed by a transitional frontier
zone where land suited to agriculture
gives way to mountains and plateau
or vast expanses of steppe grasslands
and desert. At times, the dynasties
of China became actively involved
in all of these neighboring areas,
incorporating them directly into
their expanding empires or indirectly
as subordinate, tribute-paying states.
Those areas include parts of the
Korean Peninsula, Northeast China,
Mongolia, Central Asia, and Vietnam.
Within China proper, two rivers
were particularly important to the
formation of agricultural communities that served as the building
blocks of Chinese civilization. Those
were the Yellow River and Yangzi
River. The Yellow River meanders through the northern half of China, where a cool, dry climate
is well-suited to wheat and millet farming. Beginning far to the west, this river meanders over
dusty plateau, becomes muddied with silt, and then deposits this sediment along its middle and
lower reaches. The plains surrounding these reaches are collectively referred to as the North
China Plain. Historically, this was the heartland of Chinese civilization. However, the Yangzi
River was just as important. Located in south China where the weather is relatively warmer and
wetter, its long basin provided fertile soil for rice-paddy agriculture. Over time, the early dynasties
expanded into and included the settled agricultural communities in this region.
Japan is an island country consisting of four main islands and many smaller ones located off
the Pacific coast of the Asian continent. At 400,000 square kilometers, Japan is slightly smaller
than California, although the terrain is more rugged. Because Japan is covered by mountains and
traversed by numerous rivers, only fifteen percent of the land is suited to agriculture. Much of
that was concentrated in two plains–the Kinai Plain and Kanto Plain–making them particularly
important to Japan’s early history. Japan is also located along the Pacific Ring of Fire, where
tectonic plates composing the earth’s crust frequently move and collide. That is why earthquakes
and volcanic activity have been a constant threat to populations living on these islands.
The Korean Peninsula is the location of North and South Korea today. Prior to the twentieth
century, however, it saw a long succession of Korean kingdoms. Extending roughly 1100 kilometers

southward from the Asian landmass, the peninsula is bounded by seas to the east, west, and south,
and defined by the Yalu River to the north. Beyond that lies Northeast China which was only
periodically included in the territory of Chinese empires. Consequently, because the peninsula lies
between China to the north and west and Japan to the east, Korean dynasties have been deeply
impacted by these states’ histories and cultures. Like Japan, Korea is also mountainous, although
coastal areas and plains located to the west and south were well-suited to agriculture.
The countries of East Asia share in the region’s temperate climate and summer monsoon
season. During the summer months, warm and moist air originating from the Pacific flows
from southeast to northwest, while during the winter months cold and dry air originating from
Central Asia moves in the opposite direction. Thus, those areas of East Asia located further to
the east and south are generally warmer and wetter, and for longer periods of time. That made
them well-suited to rice-paddy agriculture, and rice consequently became the primary cereal crop
in southern China, the Korean peninsula, and the islands of Japan. While growing rice is labor
intensive, this grain also offers high yields per unit of land, so it has supported population growth
in these countries and, therefore, the formation of vibrant civilizations.
4.6 CHINA FROM NEOLITHIC VILLAGE SETTLEMENTS TO THE
SHANG KINGDOM
Chapters Two and Three covered the development of the first
major civilizations of Mesopotamia, Egypt, and India. In each case,
rivers were particularly important
to that process because they offered a stable supply of water for
agriculture. Similarly, in China, the
first major states emerged along
China’s second longest river–the
Yellow River. These states are the
Xia [shee-ah] Dynasty (c. 1900
– 1600 BCE), Shang [shawng]
Dynasty (1600 – 1046 BCE), and
Zhou [joe] Dynasty (1045 – 256
BCE). Each of these kingdoms was
ruled by a line of hereditary monarchs hailing from one lineage,
which is why they are also referred
to as dynasties.
Because written sources don’t
become available until the Shang

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
Dynasty, historians have relied
heavily on the archaeological record to reconstruct the process by
which these states arose. Looking
back at the end of the Paleolithic
era (c. 10,000 BCE), East Asia was
sparsely populated by bands of
foragers living in temporary settlements. During the eighth millennium BCE, in China, some of
these hunter-gatherers turned to
domesticated cereals for a stable
food supply and settled into villages so they could cultivate them.
Thus, the Neolithic Age (8000 –
2000 BCE) commenced.
Over the course of those six
millennia leading up to the Xia
Dynasty, Neolithic communities
became more diverse and
complex. For instance, for the period 5000 – 3000 BCE, archaeologists have identified at least
eight major regional Neolithic cultures located along rivers and coasts (see Map 4.2). They did so
by examining pottery styles and village settlement patterns. One example is Yangshao culture,
which was concentrated along the middle reaches of the Yellow River. Over one thousand sites left
behind by millet-farming village communities have been discovered. Jiangzhai (c. 4000 BCE), for
instance, was a moated village settlement that occupied roughly thirteen acres (see Figure 4.2). It
was composed of related lineages and tribal in organization.
During the third millennium BCE, Yangshao culture was gradually supplanted by Longshan
culture (c. 3000 – 1900 BCE), which emerged further to the east, along the middle and lower
reaches of the Yellow River. In 1928, when archaeologists excavated a site near the town after
which Longshan was named, they found evidence for a culture that had laid the foundations for the
kingdoms that emerged in the second millennium BCE, including the ruins of numerous walled
towns with cemeteries outside (see Map 4.3). Their rammed-earth walls protected urban areas
with public buildings, roads, and drainage systems. The cemetery’s arrangement suggests that
people living in the towns were buried alongside clan members, but also that some members were
wealthier and more powerful: while most graves had nothing but a skeleton, others contained
numerous artifacts, such as pottery and jade.
Based on this evidence, archaeologists have concluded that, during the third millennium
BCE, population grew and some of it shifted from villages to walled towns. These walled towns
developed into political and economic centers exercising control over and serving as protection
for surrounding communities. Individuals with more elaborate graves were likely political and

religious leaders, and served as chieftains.
Hence, numerous competing chiefdoms
emerged, providing the foundation for
more powerful kingdoms to follow.
Ancient Chinese histories identify the
first major kingdom as the Xia Dynasty
(c. 1900 – 1600 BCE). However, these
were written many centuries after
the kingdom about which they speak
and, lacking written evidence from the
dynasty itself, specialists have been
unable to definitively establish its
location. Nevertheless, most agree that
the Xia capital was located along the
Yellow River at Erlitou [are-lee-toe]
(see Map 4.3). At its peak of activity
from 1900 – 1600 BCE, this town looks
like something more complex than a
chiefdom. Erlitou included a central,
walled palace complex (see Figure
4.3), workshops for the production of
bronze and pottery, and elite burials
containing bronze weapons and jade,
suggesting a socially stratified, Bronze
Age civilization and kingdom. That is
why many historians identify it as the
capital of the Xia Dynasty.
With the Shang Dynasty (1600
– 1046 BCE), we formally step into
China’s historical period. In 1899, in
an apothecary, a Chinese scholar came
across mysterious bones that were
being ground up for use as medicine.
He immediately recognized that the
Chinese characters inscribed on them
were very ancient. Subsequently,
the origin of these bones was
traced to fields in Anyang [anneyawng], China where, beginning in
1928, excavations were carried out.

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
Similar to the discovery of the Indus
Valley Civilization, a lost civilization was
revealed on the North China Plain, the one
difference being that traditional histories
of a later time had documented this one
(see Map 4.4).
The findings were substantial. A
diverse array of settlements with a royal
capital at the center covered nearly
thirty square kilometers (see Map
4.5). Archaeologists have identified 53
pounded earth foundations as the floors
of royal palace-temples and the ruins in
their vicinity as residential areas for elites
and commoners; sacrificial pits; and
workshops for the production of bronze,
pottery, and stone. Also, a royal cemetery
with eight large tombs and dozens of
smaller ones lies to the northwest. The
larger graves were roughly half the size of a
football field, each accessible through
four ramps whose orientation to the
cardinal directions gives them the
appearance of crosses. Deep down
at the bottom of each tomb’s central
shaft, wooden chambers were built to
house the dead bodies of Shang kings.
Shockingly to us, dozens of human
skeletons were placed above and
below these, presumably as servants to
accompany rulers in the afterlife (view
reconstruction of a Xia Dynasty palace
at Erlitou at the following link: http://

world/tours/china-erlitou2.jpg).
Anyang, we now know, served
as the last capital of the Shang
Dynasty, from 1200 to 1046 BCE.
It was at the center of a loosely
governed territorial state located

on the North China Plain. Shang kings directly governed the capital and its vicinity, but likely
controlled areas farther out by building confederations with locally powerful lineage chieftains,
and regularly hunting, warring, and carrying out rituals with them. Some of those leaders were
directly related to the Shang kings, and some were allies by marriage.
The bones are the most important source for understanding this kingdom. Most of the two
hundred thousand fragments found so far are either turtle plastrons or scapula from cows.
Interestingly, these were used for divination, which is why they are called oracle bones (see

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
Figure 4.5). When Shang kings or his
diviners sought to know the future,
they would proceed to a temple erected
in honor of a Shang deity or the spirits
of deceased ancestors in the royal
line. Before a stone tablet, they would
make a statement about what might
happen (for example, “It will rain,” or
“If we attack the Mafang [high god],
Di will confer assistance on us”), and
then apply heat to a hole bored into a
bone until it cracked. The crack was
viewed as the response from the god or
spirit. The king would then determine
whether or not it was auspicious, and
a record would be inscribed on the
bone, sometimes including the actual
outcome (see Figure 4.6). From these,
we know that Shang elites believed that
a high god Di, nature gods, and the spirits of deceased kings controlled the future. That is why
Shang kings had massive bronzes cast and carried out sacrifices for them. The bronzes were filled
with food and placed at the temples, literally to feed
the spirits. Likewise, the sacrificial pits show that
a substantial shedding of blood for these higher
powers was a regular occurrence. Shang elites
worshipped their ancestors and frequently divined
to determine their will.
4.7 THE LONG ZHOU DYNASTY
(1046 – 256 BCE)
After the Xia and Shang, the next major dynasty
in Chinese history is the Zhou Dynasty (1045 –
256 BCE). In 1046 BCE, a Zhou king overthrew the
last Shang ruler and established control over much
of north China. In the early centuries of Zhou rule,
during the Western Zhou (1046 – 771 BCE), Zhou
kings dispatched kinsmen to territories he granted
to them (see Map 4.6). These nobles were allowed
to rule their own lands hereditarily, so long as they
observed certain obligations to their king.

But over time, Zhou kings lost their ability to control these lords, and the lords became
increasingly independent. In 771 BCE, in what became a telling sign of weakness, the Zhou king
was murdered and his young successor was compelled to relocate farther east, to a capital closer
to the heart of the North China Plain. This move marked the beginning of the Eastern Zhou (770
– 256 BCE). Over the long course of this half millennium, Zhou nobility engaged in escalating
warfare with each other over matters small and large. As they did so, their lands evolved into
powerful states (see Map 4.7). Eventually, the noble lords of the most powerful states also declared
themselves kings, and fought to gain control over all of China. During the third century BCE,
the Zhou Kingdom was destroyed and one of these warring states, the Qin [Cheen] Dynasty,
prevailed over the rest.
But these centuries were not only marked by the growth of states and accelerating warfare
between them. Burgeoning turmoil also inspired much thinking about what was needful to restore
order and create a good society, as well as what defined the good life. Two major philosophical
traditions emerged to address these issues: Confucianism and Daoism.
4.7.1 The Western Zhou Dynasty (1046 – 771 BCE)
In the eleventh century BCE, the Zhou state was a minor power on the western periphery of
the Shang realm, located along the Wei [way] River. In 1059, upon witnessing five planets align,
the Zhou ruler declared himself king and proceeded to engage in military conquests that made
his kingdom a regional power to be reckoned with. This was King Wen (“Cultured King”), a ruler
revered as the founder of the Zhou dynasty. But it was his son King Wu (“Martial King”) who
brought down the Shang Dynasty. He assumed the throne upon his father’s death and, in 1046, led
three-hundred chariots and 45,000 foot soldiers equipped with bronze armor and pole-mounted
dagger-axes to a location just outside the Shang capital, where he met with and decisively defeated
the last Shang king and his army.
King Wu then returned to his capital in the Wei River Valley, where he passed away in 1043 BCE.
His young son took the throne, but was placed under the regency of Wu’s capable brother, the Duke
of Zhou. Now, the Zhou royal court was faced with the task of governing newly conquered territory,
including the former lands of the Shang Dynasty. The king and his regent did so by implementing
three policies. First, they established a secondary capital farther east at Luoyang [low-yawng], closer
to the North China Plain. Second, they issued proclamations explaining to conquered peoples why
they should accept Zhou rule. According to the Duke of Zhou, Heaven had decreed that Shang
kings must fall and Zhou rulers should replace them. The Shang dynasty had begun with wise and
benevolent rulers, but later kings were cruel and incompetent, and failed to see to the well-being
of their subjects. Thus, a dynasty once sanctioned by Heaven had lost this sanction; now, Heaven
had called upon Zhou rulers to overthrow the Shang dynasty and initiate a new era of just rule. This
political theory, which is known as the Mandate of Heaven, would also be used by founders of
later dynasties to justify their actions, as well as by theorists to explain the rise and fall of dynasties.
The third policy the Zhou court adopted was to dispatch royal kinsmen to strategically critical
locations for the purpose of establishing colonies. At their royal palaces, Zhou kings conducted

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
ceremonies of investiture during which they
sacrificed to Heaven and the spirits of deceased
ancestors, held banquets, and then bestowed
noble titles and grants of land upon members
of the royal family and relatives by marriage.
Large bronzes were cast to commemorate
these occasions (see Figure 4.7). These lords–
dukes, marquis, earls, and barons–then took
their families, contingents of soldiers, and
emblems of nobility to the granted territory
and set up palaces and ancestral temples in
walled towns. From there, these illustrious
lineages governed a predominantly rural
population of farmers living in villages where
life was not easy. Living in hovels and with
little opportunity to leave their lord’s manors,
these farmers were required to work his lands
and also to submit a portion of the harvest
from their own small farms.
Historians call this method of governing
Zhou kinship feudalism. Feudalism
generally describes a political and economic
system characterized by fragmented authority,
a set of obligations (usually of a military
nature) between lords and vassals, and grants
of land (“fiefs”) by rulers in exchange for
some type of service (see Chapters Three and
Twelve). Indeed, Zhou kings granted land
and noble titles to kinsmen in exchange for
obedience, periodic visits to the king’s palace, tribute, and military support. However, aside from
the presence of royal overseers, a hereditary lord enjoyed relative sovereignty in his own domain.
The glue that held the Zhou feudal order together was deference to the king and his Mandate
and reverence for their shared history–including, most importantly, the deceased spirits of their
related ancestors.
Over time, however, Zhou kinship feudalism failed to function as intended by the founding
rulers. In brief, Zhou kings’ ability to control the noble lords diminished over time, and their
prestige suffered accordingly. There were two principal reasons for this. First, ties of kinship so
crucial to the founding of Zhou lost their meaning over time. In later generations, lords simply
became more interested in and identified with their own territories, and they had little sense of
solidarity with what were at best distant cousins ruling neighboring feudal states. Hence, it is
hardly surprising that histories inform us that the many lords ceased to pay visits to the king’s

court. Second, Zhou kings were unable to impose their will on feuding feudal lords and were
even defeated by them in several military campaigns. In 771 BCE, for instance, King You [yo] was
attacked by the allied forces of the lord of Shen and tribal peoples residing out west. The capital
was sacked, and he was killed. Other states came to the rescue, relocating the king’s son, Prince
Ping, to the eastern capital at Luoyang. Zhou kings remained there for the next five hundred years,
during the period called the Eastern Zhou.
4.7.2 The Eastern Zhou Dynasty (770 – 256 BCE) and the Warring
States Period (c. 475 – 221 BCE)
When King Ping was relocated to Luoyang, he ruled from a much smaller royal domain
surrounded by approximately 150 feudal states and their lords. His and his successors’ power was,
however, much reduced. No longer able to impose their will on unruly noble lineages, Zhou kings
failed to maintain a semblance of peace and order throughout the realm. Instead, this warrior
nobility engaged in an escalating contest for power and prestige. By 475 BCE, in the wake of 540
wars fought over the course of two centuries, only fifteen states remained (see Map 4.7). But they
fought even more fiercely. Over the next 250 years, during what is referred to as the Warring

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
States Period (475 – 221 BCE), these states averaged one major battle per year until, at the very
end, only one remained standing. That was the state of Qin [cheen]. The Warring States period
ended in 221 BCE when the Qin ruler defeated the remaining states and unified the former Zhou
realm, initiating a new period in China’s history. The line of Zhou kings had, however, already
been extinguished in 256 BCE, so that date marks the end of the Eastern Zhou Dynasty.
As the frequency and scale of warfare escalated, and states gradually gobbled each other up,
the way feudal lords governed their states and conducted military campaigns changed. Prior to
the Warring States Period, Zhou kings were still accorded a level of respect, at least as symbols of
unity and nominal heads of the Zhou feudal order. At this point, the many lords had no intention
of toppling the king; rather, seeing his military weakness, the most powerful ones stepped in to
enforce order. The first was Duke Huan of Qi [who-an of chee]. He held this title (“duke”) and fief
(Qi) because his distant ancestor had served as a commander under King Wu during the Zhou
founding. Now, many generations later, his state was a formidable power on the east coast. In

651 BCE, he convened an interstate meeting with other lords to discuss matters of order and
security. Upon being elected as their leader, the Zhou king conferred the title of hegemon. In this
capacity, Duke Huan had the authority to resolve disputes between nobles on behalf of the king.
Over the next two centuries, this title changed hands several times, going to the lord of the
most powerful state. These hegemons periodically convened interstate meetings to manage such
matters as misbehaving states or foreign invasions. Attending lords cemented their agreements by
swearing oaths and drinking the blood of sacrificed animals. Yet, although hegemons maintained
a semblance of order, warfare remained constant because it was a way of life for the illustrious
lineages of the Zhou realm. Noble lords loved to demonstrate their prowess and raise their prestige
through success in hunting and battling. A noble looked for a pretext to engage in a vendetta with
another lord, at which point a battle was arranged and then carried out according to the protocols of
chivalry. After announcing the impending campaign at the ancestral temple, a lord and his kinsmen,
accompanied by farmer foot soldiers, would proceed in their chariots to a prearranged location
and engage in a skirmish. In victory, a noble redressed matters of honor and brought glory to his
ancestors, something symbolized by the mound of dead enemies placed by his ancestral temple.
However, with the onset of the Warring States Period in the fifth century BCE, the level of
violence was no longer contained by the hegemon system and codes of chivalry. Both the purpose
and conduct of warfare changed. Lords of the seven most powerful states lost respect for the Zhou
kings and even assumed the same title, thus claiming the right to unify all of China under their
rule. As opposed to serving a lesson to and resolving some dispute with another lord, these selfdeclared kings waged war to destroy them and take their land.
Hence, battles became increasingly bloody and bitter, and victory went to those kings who
could field the most effective killing machines. Chariot-riding kinsmen and a few thousand foot
soldiers no longer met that requirement. During the Warring States, rulers introduced large armies
composed of mass infantry and cavalry. Soldiers were equipped with armor, crossbows, halberds,
dagger-axes, and swords manufactured from bronze, iron, leather, and wood in royal workshops
located at capital cities. (View the image of a Warring States Period soldier at the following
link: http://brandonqindynasty.weebly.com/uploads/1/0/3/9/10391259/8580061.jpeg. One
description of an elite soldier states that he wears heavy armor, shoulders a large crossbow and
fifty arrows, straps a halberd to his back, buckles a helmet to his head, and places a sword to his
side.) Kings also militarized their kingdoms’ landscapes by building forts at strategically critical
passes, walls to mark off boundaries, and watch towers to signal the enemy’s approach. Finally,
these rulers no longer relied solely on close kinsmen to wage war alongside them. Rather, they
created a class of military commanders and specialists whose promotion was based on their
ability to produce victories in the field. It is therefore not surprising that during this time some
of China’s greatest military treatises were written, most notably the Art of War by Master Sun
[sue-in]. Master Sun was a military commander and strategist who served the lords of the state
of Wu just prior to the onset of the Warring States period (c. fifth century BCE). The manual of
military strategy and tactics attributed to him stresses the importance of formulating a strategy
that insures victory prior to any campaigning. Stratagem is critical. “All warfare is deception,”
Master Sun states. “Hence, when able to attack, we must seem unable; when using our forces, we 
Page | 127
CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
must seem inactive; when we are near, we must make the enemy believe we are far away; when far
away, we must make him believe we are near.”
To mobilize large numbers of men for war and supply them with weapons and grain, kings
devised ways to make their realms more productive and compliant with their will. Prior to the
Warring States Period, it was the norm for nobility to hand out land in their states to kinsmen, just
as it had been for the king during the Western Zhou. This practice meant that lesser but related
aristocratic lineages lived in estates across each noble’s territory, while also serving as ministers at
his court. For a king, however, these men might become an obstacle or pose a threat because they
held this land hereditarily. Therefore, they devised better ways to control land in their realms.
Whenever new territory was added or a noble line was extinguished, kings created counties and
appointed magistrates to manage the villages and towns in that area. The magistrate’s job would
then be to register the population, maintain law and order, collect tax revenue, and conscript
people for labor projects and military campaigns. And rather than give those posts to kinsmen,
kings appointed men from the lower ranks of the nobility or commoners based on their loyalty
and merit. Stated more simply, Warring States Period rulers created administrative units and a
civil service. Their embryonic bureaucracies included such features as a system of official posts,
salaries paid in grain and gifts, administrative codes, and methods for measuring a servant’s
performance. Thus, by the end of this period, largely owing to the demands of warfare, the Zhou
feudal order had been supplanted by a small number of powerful territorial states with centralized
monarchies. Among them, the most successful was the state of Qin, which eventually conquered
all of China and became an empire. We return to that topic after reviewing the ideas put forward
by philosophers in the context of these centuries of turmoil.
4.7.3 Philosophy in a Time of Turmoil: Confucianism and Daoism
China’s three major pre-modern philosophical and religious traditions are Confucianism,
Daoism, and Buddhism. The first two had their origins in the later centuries of the Eastern Zhou,
while Buddhism only began to arrive from South Asia in the first century C.E. Confucianism and
Daoism were both responses to the crisis presented by the breakdown of the Zhou feudal order
and escalating warfare in China.
4.7.3.1: Confucius and Confucianism
Confucius lived just prior to the Warring States Period (551-479 BCE). What little we know
about his life comes primarily from the Analects, a record of conversations Confucius held with
his students compiled after he died. In later centuries, in China, Confucius was revered as a sage
and teacher, and even today outside of China some people might think of him as a stern pedant,
perhaps calling to mind sayings beginning with “The Master said.” However, in the context of
his time, Confucius was anything but stiff and rather a dynamic individual who believed he was
mandated by Heaven to return the world to a more socially and politically harmonious time. The
Analects not only shows a serious and learned man, but also someone capable in archery and
horsemanship, who loved music and ritual, and who untiringly travelled the feudal states in the 
Page | 128
hopes of serving in a lord’s retinue (see Figure 4.8). According to
one passage, a lord once asked one of Confucius’s students about
his master, but the student fell silent. Later, Confucius asked
him, “Why did you not say: As a man, when agitated in thought
he forgets to eat, joyfully forgetting his cares, not realizing that
old age is near at hand?”
Confucius was born to a family of minor nobility and modest
means in the feudal state of Lu. His father died about the time
Confucius was born, and he was raised by his mother, who also
passed away when Confucius was young. Like other young men
of similar background, he had access to an education and could
aspire to serve in some capacity in a feudal state, perhaps at the
lord’s court, or as an official or soldier. Confucius chose to become
learned and seek office. To his mind, he was living at a time
when civilization was collapsing and society was decaying. He
believed that, during the early Zhou, the nobility was honorable,
observed moral codes, and upheld social standards. He believed
that a golden age existed in the past and wished to transmit the
ethical values of that time. However, in the course of doing so, he
reinterpreted the past and imbued the virtues he stressed with
rich, new meanings. Here are a few of the important statements
Confucius made, and what they meant:
1. “The noble person is concerned with rightness,
the small person is concerned with profit.” (4.16) Confucius redefined the meaning
of nobility. For him, nobility was defined not by birth but rather by character and
conduct. A truly noble person is one who puts what is right before personal gain and
the desire for wealth and fame.
2. “Young men should be filial at home and respectful to their elders when away from
home.” (1.6) Filial piety is central to Confucius’s thought. He taught how a person
becomes moral because a good society only develops when composed of and led by
virtuous people. He saw the practice of morality in the family as the root. Should a
young man learn to be respectful and reverent towards parents and elders, he will
become a humane person, and humane people are far more likely to contribute in a
positive way to society.
3. “The noble man does not abandon humaneness for so much as the space of a meal.”
(4.5) For Confucius, the highest virtue is humanity, and many of his conversations
center upon defining what it is that makes a person humane. A person of humanity is,
for instance, one who is capable of empathy and unselfish concern for the welfare of
others. They know the golden rule: “what you would not want for yourself,” he taught,

Dynasty

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
“do not do to others.” (15.23) Confucius emphasized that a society cannot function if
people are incapable of taking other’s perspectives and doing their best for them. In
addition, he insisted that such virtues as humanity are most fully demonstrated when
individuals observe good etiquette. Decorum was important to Confucius.
4. “Heaven has given birth to the virtue that is in me.” 1
 (7.22) Interpreters of Confucius
have rightly noted that he is quite silent about the supernatural and what happens
after death, rather emphasizing the life we have and serving others. Yet, it would be
wrong to conclude that he wasn’t religious in any sense, because he frequently spoke
of Heaven. He believed that Heaven ordains a certain course of life for each individual,
including becoming a moral person. This Heaven, however, is less a deity than a
higher moral order, a kind of beneficent presence.
5. “To govern is to rectify. If you lead the people by being rectified yourself, who will dare
not be rectified?” (12.17) Confucius believed that good governing flows from good men.
The first qualification for a ruler or one who serves is moral rectitude. If those who
lead do so by virtue and conduct themselves according to rules of propriety, people
will learn from them and develop a sense of honor and shame. Consequently, society
will become more orderly.
The noble person, filial piety, humaneness, etiquette, Heaven, and government by men of virtue
are just some of the ideas Confucius discussed as he traveled the feudal states seeking to advise their
lords. However, he only managed to hold some minor offices in Lu and generally failed in his political
aspirations. Instead, he gained an avid following of 70 students, whom he accepted regardless of
their social status. After he died, they passed on his teachings, and a school of thought emerged
from his teachings known as Confucianism. Those who belonged to it are Confucians–individuals
distinguished by their commitment to the ideas articulated by Confucius, classical learning, and the
value they place on character and conduct as the key to a good society and political order.
4.7.3.2: Philosophical and Institutional Daoism
During the turmoil of the Warring States period, however, other individuals developed a
philosophy very different from Confucianism called Daoism. These Daoists largely rejected
Confucian ideas about human moral development and social order as artificial constructs. Rather,
they pointed to a natural condition that both individuals and society can recover, one that existed
before desires trapped people in a world of strife. Their central concept is the Dao (“Way”). The
Dao is mysterious: it is beyond sense perception and yet the source of life and the universe, the
ultimate truth transcending the polarities that make up life and yet pervades them, empty and yet
the mother of all things.
Paradoxically, although the Dao is indescribable and can’t be seen or heard, the goal of the
Daoist is to accord with and follow it. But this goal won’t be accomplished through more seeking and
1 These selections from the Analects are translated in De Bary and Bloom, ed., Sources of Chinese Tradition, Vol. 1: From
Earliest Times to the Present, 44-63. 
Page | 130
more knowledge. Rather, the mind must be emptied
out, calmed, and purified, until desires are absent and a
primordial, natural condition is restored. At that point,
when the individual is in accord with the ineffable Way,
life becomes spontaneous, natural, and effortless.
The two most important early books belonging to this
tradition are named after their putative authors: the
Laozi (“Old Master”) and Zhuangzi (“Master Zhuang”).
Historians believe the “Old Master” was a fictional sage
invented by Warring States Period philosophers who
compiled the book attributed to him. Master Zhuang,
however, lived during the fourth century BCE.
In later centuries, the Daoism of these early
philosophers was taken in new directions. The
definition of the Way was broadened to include the
idea that individuals have a spiritual essence in need
of harmonizing and liberation. By so doing, it was
believed, one’s health would be preserved and life
prolonged. Daoists even entertained the idea that
one could become immortal. To achieve these goals,
techniques were developed, including special dietary
regimens, yoga, Chinese boxing, meditation, and
alchemy.
Over the course of the first millennium CE, Daoism also became a popular and institutionalized
religion. Daoist masters, claiming divine inspiration, composed esoteric texts for their followers.
These texts explained how the natural world originated from a primordial ether (qi) and its
division into two polar forces: the yin and yang (see Figure 4.9). They presented a universe with
multiple heavenly and hellish realms populated with divinities and demons. The principal purpose
of these Daoists was to attend to a person’s physical and psychological well-being. That involved
not only teaching individual techniques for preserving the life spirit, but also the use of exorcism
and faith healing to remove malevolent influences. Daoists also developed communal prayers and
rituals that could cure illness, free souls from hell, win blessings from heaven, and eliminate sins
from the community. Eventually, a Daoist church developed, with its own ordained priesthood,
temples, and monasteries.
4.8 THE QIN DYNASTY AND THE TRANSITION FROM ANCIENT
TO IMPERIAL CHINA
In 219 BCE, while touring his realm, the First Emperor of Qin [cheen] (259 – 210 BCE)
erected a stone tablet atop a mountain with an inscription proclaiming:
Figure 4.9 | An image representing basic
elements of Daoist cosmology | According

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
They [the Qin ministers] recall and contemplate the times of chaos:
When [regional lords] apportioned the land, established their states,
And thus unfolded the pattern of struggle.
Attacks and campaigns were daily waged;
They shed their blood in the open countryside. . . .
Now today, the August Emperor has unified All-under-Heaven into one family—
Warfare will not arise again!
Disaster and harm are exterminated and erased,
The black-headed people live in peace and stability, benefits and blessings are lasting
and enduring.2
Indeed, just two years
prior, in 221 BCE, the First
Emperor had brought the
Warring States Period to a
close by defeating the last
remaining state. Hence,
he had realized the aspirations held by the many rulers he subjugated,
that is, to unify the known
world under one powerful
monarch and, by so doing, to initiate an age of
peace and prosperity, one
rooted in obedience to a
sagely ruler.
The title “First Emperor of Qin,” however, was
assumed by this conqueror only in the wake of his
final victory, and it made
sense. Having crushed the
many warring kingdoms,
the First Emperor did indeed create something
new and more significant:
an immense territorial
state centrally administered from his capital, by a monarch with unchallenged sovereignty (see
Map 4.8). So how did his state–the Qin kingdom–prevail?

When the First Emperor inherited the Qin throne at the age of 13 in 246 BCE, he became
King Zheng [jung], young ruler of the most powerful of the seven remaining Warring States.
Looking back, he would understand that he had inherited a state whose origins dated back to
the Western Zhou Period, when land to the west of the Zhou kings was granted as a fief to his
chieftain forbears. The Qin star first rose when a Qin lord assisted King Ping in relocating to the
eastern capital during the transition from the Western to the Eastern Zhou Period (c. 770 BCE).
At that time, the old Zhou heartland was granted to him, and he was elevated to the status of a
regional lord, the Duke of Qin.
The Dukes of Qin were important players throughout the centuries of warfare and alliances so
characteristic of the Eastern Zhou, and especially after the reforms of Duke Xiao [she-ow] (r. 361
– 338). These reforms were based on the advice of his chancellor Shang Yang [shawng yawng],
an individual famed for being one of the founders of another major intellectual tradition that
developed during the Warring States Period: Legalism. The legalists were in tune with the efforts

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
rulers were putting forth to strengthen their states. Their goal was to devise the best techniques
for organizing a state’s territory and people so as to maximize a ruler’s power and control in times
of both war and peace. Legalists believed that the best way to do so was to concentrate authority
in one central administration governed by an absolute monarch.
To these ends, Shang Yang introduced many measures, laying the foundations for future Qin
greatness. He believed that the basis for state power lay with an obedient and disciplined farming
population, because that was the principal source of revenue and conscripts for the army. So he
organized villages across the land into units of five families each, and made the members of each
unit responsible for each other. Every member would be rewarded based on the amount of grain
the unit produced or the number of severed heads returned from the battlefield. For meritorious
service to the state, a unit could advance along a system of ranks, each of which bestowed certain
privileges. But should any member commit a crime, everyone would be severely punished. To make
this more effective, the Qin state developed a legal code with clear lists of penalties for specific
crimes, made it publicly available, and applied it uniformly to people regardless of their social
status. Also, the Qin was among the most effective in establishing a civil service and county system
to administer the law. Qin subjects lived under a regime with a transparent set of expectations, and
also a system of rewards and punishments. Such rationality in matters of efficiently organizing a
state through the uniform application of laws and regularizing administration, as implemented by
Shang Yang, were a mark of legalist thinkers’ methods.
After Duke Xiao’s and Shang Yang’s time, Qin rulers assumed the title of king and engaged in
numerous battles, destroying several neighboring states. Some of these were major engagements.
According to one account, after the Qin kingdom defeated the state of Zhao, a Qin general ordered
400,000 captured soldiers
buried alive. Also, the Qin
put an end to the Zhou royal
line after conquering their
territory in 256 BCE. Hence,
King Zheng was heir to a
kingdom whose success in
battle derived in part from
legalist reforms. In line
with that tradition, he too
employed a legalist advisor.
As of 230 BCE, only
six other Warring States
remained (see Map 4.9).
Over the next decade, King
Zheng led a series of massive
campaigns each of which
entailed both sides fielding
over one hundred thousand

soldiers. This was a bloody time, as one state after another fell. By 221 BCE, the Chinese realm was
unified under Qin rule.
Although the Qin Dynasty (221 – 207 BCE) was brief-lived, it had a lasting effect on China
because of the stable administrative foundation it laid. The First Emperor of Qin and his advisors
invented the title used by all subsequent rulers. They made newly conquered territory a part
of their centralized bureaucracy. From his royal court and central administration, the emperor
governed a land organized into a hierarchical system of commanderies (provinces that began as
military outposts) and counties. His regime standardized currency and the system of writing, and
issued regulations for uniform weights and measures.
The emperor was also a great builder. Over 6800 kilometers of road were laid to connect the
capital at Xianyang to each province and the northern border. Walls built by former northern
states to protect against non-Chinese nomads to their north were linked together in an earlier
version of the Great Wall. All of these measures served to facilitate communication and commerce
across the land and, therefore, political stability and cultural unification. As a symbol of his power,
the First Emperor also constructed an imposing palace (see Figure 4.10) and mausoleum (see
Introduction). For all these reasons, historians mark Qin unification as the beginning of China’s
imperial era.
4.9 THE HAN DYNASTY, 202 BCE – 220 CE
After the First Emperor died in 210 BCE, the Qin Empire rapidly disintegrated. Historians
debate causes but highlight weak successors manipulated by the intrigues of a high minister and
court eunuch; excessive demands on the population for building projects, tax revenue, and military
conscription; and a climate of fear created by the harshly punitive legal system. Regardless, by
207 BCE revolts were breaking out across the land, as rebels accrued armies, seized territory,
and even declared themselves kings. China then fell into a state of civil war for five years until the
intervention of Liu Bang [lee-oh bawng] (d. 195 BCE). A former farmer and village headman
who rebelled and built an army and kingdom through his military acumen and charisma, Liu
Bang defeated his adversaries and declared himself emperor of a new dynasty.
4.9.1 Government and Society during the Han Dynasty
The Han Dynasty, ruled by 24 successive emperors from the Liu imperial family, is normally
divided into a Western Han (202 – 8 BCE) and Eastern Han (25 – 220 CE) because for a brief
time an imperial in-law usurped the throne and established his own short-lived dynasty. This
brief interregnum aside, the Han Dynasty lasted 400 years, making it second in length only to
the Zhou Dynasty. So important was the Han to establishing a pattern in Chinese civilization
distinguishing people belonging to it from those around them that Chinese people today refer to
their ethnic group as Han Chinese. Also, after adopting the foundations laid by the Qin Dynasty,
the Han further strengthened them, cementing an imperial pattern that persisted in China until
the fall of the last dynasty (Qing) in 1911.

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
As opposed to studying a chronology of important events during these centuries, let’s consider
the general picture for the political system and society of the Han Empire. The majority of people–
as much as 90 percent of the population–were farmers, living out their lives in villages of a dozen
to over 100 households. Some were independent farmers who owned small farms; some, tenants
who leased land from owners of larger farms; and some, local magnates with large estates (see
Figure 4.11). The government relied heavily on the first group for revenue and conscription and
therefore tried to keep these owner-farmers in business with low taxes, relief in times of hardship,
and improvement in their agricultural methods. Unfortunately, over the course of the dynasty,
many farmers fell on hard times and were forced to sell their land to powerful landlords, thus
becoming their tenants or even slaves. Landlordism thus became a major social and political
problem, as local great families dominated ever more dependent poor, undermining the central
government’s revenue base.

Chang’an, while during the Eastern Han, it was located at Luoyang. Note the location of the Xiongnu
confederation of nomadic pastoralists living on the steppe lands to the north of China. Han China
also extended control far into Central Asia in order to secure the Silk Road trade routes. Most of the
dependent states and tributary cities indicated by green and orange dots were brought under the
control of China during the reign of Emperor Wu.

The remaining ten percent of the population lived in urban areas–the towns and cities of
Han China–as artisans and traders or officials and garrison soldiers. By some estimates, the total
population during these centuries hovered at 60 million, which means about six million were urban
residents. Many cities, such as the capitals of both the Western and Eastern Han, had over 100,000
residents (see Map 4.10). The first imperial capital, Chang’an [chawng-an] (“Forever Peace”), was
a walled city with twelve gates, watchtowers, market places, residential wards, administrative
buildings and, of course, the imperial palace. Some of the agricultural produce, manufactured
goods, and raw materials filling up the marketplaces testify to what artisans and traders were
busy making, buying, and selling: cooked meats, pickled vegetables, fish, and grains; utensils and
tools made of wood, brass, and iron; lacquer ware, jade, and furs; and textiles fashioned from silk
and hemp. Imperial highways and lesser byways, and canals and other waterways, provided the
routes for moving these goods both within and beyond China. Ever suspicious of the profit motive
and believing in the foundational importance of the farmer, government officials supervised city
markets and established agencies to regulate the most important industries.
These commoner classes–farmers,
artisans, and traders–were governed
by a highly organized state and its
corps of educated, professional civil
servants. For administrative purposes,
the empire was eventually divided into
roughly 100 commanderies and 1300
counties. 130,000 officials constituted
the bureaucracy. At the lowest level,
working with village and town leaders,
county magistrates handled such
matters as tax collection, population
registration, conscription for military
service, law and order, and public
works. They submitted reports to, and
took orders from, commandery level
military and civil officials, who then
did the same with the nine ministries
of the central government. These
ministries handled such matters as
revenue, justice, and foreign relations.
The heads of each of these ministries, as well as two chancellors, routinely held audiences with the
emperor to decide all policy matters. An independent branch of government, the censorate, audited
the rest and reported directly to the emperor.
 From the outset, the Han Dynasty inherited the Qin legalist system of government, with its
emphasis on rational and efficient methods of administration and use of systems of rewards and
punishments to promote order. However, early in the Han, Confucian scholars criticized Qin

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
governing for lacking humaneness, and Han rulers increasingly saw the benefit of Confucian ideas
to governing. This change was particularly the case with Emperor Wu [woo] (r. 141 – 87 BCE).
During his reign, Confucius’s ideas were molded into an ideology that legitimated monarchy and
a hierarchical social order. This ideology is called Imperial Confucianism. As an ideology, it
simply provided a blueprint for how the political and social order should function.
Rulers saw the benefit in having officials who were highly educated, loyal, of good character,
and who understood the formalities of ritual and etiquette. An Imperial Academy was founded
at the capital in 124 so that students could be educated in classical Confucian texts, including
the Analects. Across the country, these students were nominated by local officials based on
their learnedness and virtuous conduct. Successful graduates went on to serve as officials, and,
because that conferred the highest prestige and status on an individual in Han China, Confucian
values penetrated society. Texts were compiled explaining good etiquette, conduct, and ritual
requirements for each family member and members of society based on their superior or
subordinate status. Filial piety was celebrated in both art and texts (see Figure 4.12), and law
codes reinforced social norms by, for example, supporting the authority of the family patriarch,
division of property among sons, and arranged marriages. In brief, over the course of the Han
Dynasty, Chinese increasingly identified themselves as defenders of a Confucian civilization.
The emperor was at the pinnacle of both Han society and the political system, while the
imperial family and in-laws constituted a privileged aristocracy. The emperor’s authority derived

demonstrate their reverence and respect for parents.

in theory from his having received the mandate of Heaven, his virtue, and his role as mediator
between the celestial realms and human world; as such, he could expect his subjects’ obedience
and loyalty. He resided within the walls of the imperial palace at the capital city, attended by
eunuchs who handled his personal needs, palace administration, and the imperial harem.
Emperors had numerous consorts but also a principal wife–the empress–who held a special
status and was quite influential, usually because she bore the heir to the throne, but also because
she and her in-laws were an intimate part of the emperor’s palace life. Often, the imperial family,
imperial in-laws, eunuchs, and high officials broke apart into squabbling factions fighting for
power and influence; this contention had deleterious consequences for the smooth functioning
of the political system.
4.9.2 China and the Outer World during the Han Dynasty
Strengthened by its ever more confident political system and society, Han China also became
an expansive empire, occupying and colonizing territory all along its borders. Sometimes this
process was gradual: as migrants and merchants moved into neighboring areas, the government
followed by setting up garrisons to protect them and eventually counties with civil servants to
govern them. In other cases, armies were sent to subdue unstable borders or to secure trade
routes. Regardless, as the dominant power in the region, China’s actions profoundly influenced
and shaped the history of peoples and states in neighboring areas of Central and East Asia.
Traditionally, the biggest threats to the settled agricultural population of China came from
non-Chinese nomadic pastoralists scattered about the steppe lands along the northern border
(see Chapter Ten). These skilled horsemen and hunters tended their herds from horseback,
resided in mobile campsites made up of yurts, and organized as tribes. These tribes usually
selected the most skilled male warriors as their chieftains and also periodically organized into
confederations so as to raid Chinese villages and towns (see Chapter Ten). During the Han, the
most threatening confederation was knit together by Xiongnu [she-ong-new] (see Map 4.10). The
founding emperor, Liu Bang, sought to subdue them with his armies but was defeated and forced
to pay tribute and offer imperial princesses in marriage to their chieftains. Emperor Wu, however,
enjoying a stronger government, sent massive armies of over 100,000 soldiers campaigning deep
into Xiongnu territory, breaking up their confederation and forcing them to relocate. Although
his armies suffered great losses, Emperor Wu established garrisons across the northern border to
consolidate his gains and protect China.
As Emperor Wu brought the Xiongnu under control, he became curious about Central
Asian territories lying to the west of China. Interested in finding allies that might support him
in his efforts to control nomad confederations, he sent envoys on exploratory missions. They
returned with news of trade routes extending from oasis city-states ringing the forbidding
deserts of the Taklamakan Desert to countries lying beyond the Pamir Mountains. What they
were speaking of were the earliest Silk Roads (see Map 4.11). Merchants had been using
camels to carry such goods as silk from China to distant civilizations while bringing back
gold, horses, and various handicrafts and foodstuffs. For that reason, beginning in 104 BCE, 
Page | 139
CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
Emperor Wu dispatched armies to subdue the region as far as the Pamir Mountains, making
the Han Dynasty overlords to Central Asian states, which were now obligated to send tribute
and hostages. A frontier network of walls and watchtowers was then extended partway into the
region. The Silk Roads were thus secured, and, because it could be conducted more safely, the
volume of traffic grew. During the Han Dynasty, China demonstrated its intention of being a
dominant player in Central Asia.
4.9.3 Conclusion: The Han Dynasty and Empires in History
These are some of the outstanding features of the Han Empire, and ones that can also be
compared to other empires that existed at this time in other parts of the world, such as Mauryan
Empire in India (see Chapter Three), Persian Empire in the Middle East (Chapter Five), or Roman
Empire (see Chapter Six). Each empire conferred a special status on rulers, had an organized
imperial administration with an educated civil service, maintained a large army to defend an
expanding and increasingly well-defined territory, and developed an ideology and legal codes
that justified authority and reinforced social order. Confident in the superiority of their organized
governments, powerful militaries, and worldview, each of these empires proceeded to extend
control over neighboring states and peoples.

4.10 THE PERIOD OF DIVISION, 220 – 589 CE
Like these other empires, the Han Dynasty also eventually fell. China was then divided up
by independent, short-lived kingdoms until 589 CE, when the Sui Dynasty reunited most of
the territory once controlled by the Han. Thus, for four centuries, during what is known as the
Period of Division, China was politically unstable and racked by endemic warfare. Yet, in spite
of the violence, these centuries also saw vibrant cultural developments, as Buddhism became an
organized institutional religion reshaping the spiritual landscape.
4.10.1 Political History–From Three Kingdoms (220 – 280) and the Western
Jin (265 – 317) to the Northern and Southern Dynasties (317 – 589)
During the second century CE, a combination of factors led to massive rebellions against
the Han Dynasty by lower classes living in the countryside. Many once thriving, independent
farmers who fell on hard times lost their land to powerful local families who used their political
connections to amass large estates. A series of floods and droughts and the famines and epidemics
they caused only worsened these farmers’ plight, and the government was ineffective in providing
relief. During the later Han, government revenue had fallen because local magnates kept their
growing estates off the tax rolls. Also, many later Liu emperors were mere youths dominated by
quarreling factions of imperial in-laws and eunuchs, so the quality of governing declined.
Desperate to escape poverty and starvation, many villagers fled their homes or joined roving
bandit gangs. Some rallied behind individuals who promised the dawn of a new age, thereby
becoming part of large, militarized religious societies with political goals. One was the Yellow
Turbans, a society named after the yellow cloth members wrapped around their heads. The
founder, Zhang Jue [jawng joo-eh], claimed he was a devoted follower of the legendary Daoist
philosopher Laozi, who had by this time been deified and envisioned living in a Daoist heaven. Zhang
accrued a following of disciples by instructing them in faith healing, establishing a rudimentary
organization, and prophesying an impending apocalypse. He led his followers to believe that the
apocalypse would be followed by an age of peace when the sky would turn yellow and all would
be equal. The movement grew into the tens of thousands. Some followers proclaimed 184 CE
was propitious, daubing the characters for that year in mud on the gates to government offices.
The Yellow Turbans rebelled, and unrest spread across north China. Other similar millenarian
religious movements followed.
The Han Dynasty was in crisis but lacked the strong leadership of earlier rulers like the
founder Liu Bang or Emperor Wu. Youthful emperors were forced to rely on generals who
commanded permanent standing armies around the empire as if they were private possessions.
But by empowering military strongmen to suppress rebellions, Han rulers sealed the fate of the
dynasty. Generals feuded amongst each other and competed to impose a military dictatorship
on the court. Eventually, in 220 CE, one general deposed the Han emperor, but he failed to
unite the realm because by that time the country had been divided up by three kingdoms and
their rival warlords.

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
Within their realms, each warlord sought to strengthen his hand against the others by
restoring order and establishing a functioning state. After all, they needed fighting men and
revenue. Cao Cao (155 – 220 CE) was the most effective in achieving these goals. He was
the adopted son of a Han court eunuch and eventually entered the military. As a commander,
he earned his spurs leading Han armies against the Yellow Turbans. As the dynasty fell apart,
he gained control over it and established a dictatorship in northern China. It was his son who
removed the last Han ruler and established the Wei [way] Dynasty (220 – 265 AD), one of the
Three Kingdoms (see Map 4.12).
By this time, as a result of the rebellions and civil wars, much land in north China had gone to
waste. So Cao Cao turned it into huge state farms where he could settle his soldiers, landless poor, and,
most importantly, tribes of nomadic herders from the steppe lands to the far north who had served
him as he came to power. Thus, Cao rulers created colonies of farmers who supplied tax revenue

and, as hereditary military families,
soldiers for Wei armies. Such stateowned land and hereditary soldiers
became the mainstays of warlord
dynasties throughout this time.
The two other kingdoms, Wu and
Han, were located in the south. Over
the course of decades, the ruling
warlords of all three states fought
each other in campaigns involving
much treachery and stratagem. In
263 CE, the Han kingdom fell to the
invading forces of Wei commanders.
But then, just two years later, a
powerful Wei family–the Sima–
usurped the throne and changed
the kingdom’s name to Western Jin
[jean] (265 – 317 CE). The Western
Jin conquered Wu in 280 BCE,
thereby bringing to an end the Three
Kingdoms period.
The Western Jin had reunified China, but that unity
wasn’t to last. The policy of settling tribes of non-Chinese
nomads in north China backfired. Among them, rebel
chieftains rose up, carved out kingdoms of their own, and
expanded their power all across the north. One Xiongnu
chieftain, Liu Yuan [lee-oh you-anne], even declared he
was a descendant of a Han Dynasty imperial princess and
therefore had the right to restore the Han Empire. His
son descended on the Western Jin court at Luoyang and
eventually, in 317 CE, forced it to flee east to Jiankang [jeean cawng] (today’s city of Nanjing).
China was again divided up among competing dynasties,
a state of affairs that would persist until 589 CE, during a time
referred to as the Northern and Southern Dynasties (317
– 589). Six successive Southern Dynasties were all located at
Jiankang, and had as their base of power the Yangzi River
Map 4.13 | China during the Northern and Southern Dynasties |
The Eastern Jin was the first of the southern dynasties, all of which
had Jiankang as their capital. The north was divided up among
shifting kingdoms established by non-Han chieftains. The names of
these ethnic groups are indicated on the map.

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
basin (see Map 4.13). But their
rulers were usually militarily
weak and lacked revenue, due
to southern China’s comprising
a colonial frontier dominated
by powerful families with large
estates and private armies.
These families highly valued
their pedigrees, intermarried,
and saw themselves as the
heirs to Confucian civilization.
At the southern court, they
dominated high offices, thus
constituting a hereditary
aristocracy. The ruling family
was always limited in power by
their influence.
The situation was even
more complex in the north
during those three centuries.
The kingdom established by
Liu Yuan along the Yellow River was just one of numerous
short-lived Northern Dynasties established by non-Chinese chieftains of different ethnicities. The Liu rulers, for instance, were Xiongnu, while others were of Turkic ancestry. At times,
the north was divided among numerous, rival regimes, while, at others, it was unified. But all of
these kingdoms shared similar characteristics. They were ruled by military dynasts who wanted to
restore the Chinese empire. Their armies consisted of an elite, heavily armored cavalry drawn from
aristocratic military families that was supplemented by Chinese foot soldiers (see Figure 4.13).
They employed educated Chinese to serve as civil officials and administer their territories.
The Northern and Southern Dynasties came to an end in 589 CE after Yang Jian [yawng geean], a general hailing from the ruling clan of a northern kingdom, first established control over all
of north China and then defeated the last southern dynasty. He ruled his new Sui [sway] Dynasty
as Emperor Wen [one]. China was once again united under one dynasty (see Map 4.14).
4.10.2 China’s Third Great Tradition: The Introduction of Buddhism to China
Aside from the shifting configuration of kingdoms, perhaps the most notable development
during the Period of Division was the introduction of Mahayana (“Great Vehicle”) Buddhism into
Map 4.14 | Map of the Sui Dynasty | Map of the Sui Dynasty, which
reunified China at the end of the Period of Division. Neighboring states
and peoples in Sui times, as well as the boundaries of modern China, are

China (for the development of Mahayana Buddhism, see Chapter Three). Beginning from the
second century CE, at the end of the Han Dynasty, Buddhist merchants and monks from India and
Central Asia brought their faith and scriptures to China by the Silk Roads and maritime trading
routes (see Map 4.15). The impact was immense and can be compared to the Christianization of
the Mediterranean region and spread of devotional forms of Hinduism in South Asia during this
same period of time (see Chapters Three and Six). Historians estimated that by the time the Sui
Dynasty reunited China four centuries later, China had approximately 33,000 Buddhist temples
and two million monks and nuns. Buddhism had become a large-scale religious organization
with these temples, clerics, and scriptures (see Figure 4.14), as well as a widespread popular faith
capturing the imagination of common people and rulers alike.
Historians have also hypothesized why this spread occurred. First of all, Buddhism clearly
met a spiritual need. During the Period of Division, turmoil from rapid political change and
constant warfare brought much suffering and instability to people’s lives. Now, here was
a religion that explained their suffering with notions of karma and rebirth and also offered
hope with paths to salvation and enlightenment. Buddhism placed the world amidst visions of
multiple hells and heavens where merciful Buddhas and Bodhisattvas worked for the salvation
of all beings.
Buddhism appealed to people in different ways. For scholarly elites living in capital cities
or as hermits in mountain retreats, Buddhist doctrines about the nature of reality, self, and
enlightenment were appealing because they seemed similar to concepts in Daoist philosophy. Both
philosophies questioned the reality of ordinary understandings of the self and world, emphasized
that our desires create an illusory world, and offered techniques for achieving liberation. Nirvana,
for instance, was compared to the Dao (Daoist “Way”).
For rulers, Buddhism served political purposes. Since the faith became so popular, rulers who
took vows and sponsored temple construction and the ordination of monks looked good because
they were upholding the dharma, that is, the Buddhist law. Some even went so far as to have monks
recognize them as incarnate Buddhas. Lastly, Buddhist monks–whether foreign or Chinese–were
some of the most educated people at their courts and could assist rulers with mundane matters,

like international relations, but also esoteric ones, such as spells and divination. Monks won
support by promising that their rituals and incantations had magical potency.
Lastly, for most people, Buddhism was a devotional religion. Buddhas and Bodhisattvas were
merciful beings to be worshipped because their good karma redounded to the benefit of all beings.
By going to a temple and burning incense or praying and making offerings before a Buddha statue,
the faithful might have a simple wish granted: an illness cured, loved ones helped, or a better
rebirth ensured.

4.11 THE TANG DYNASTY AND THE EMERGENCE OF EAST ASIA
4.11.1 The Early Tang Dynasty
The Sui [sway] Dynasty did not last long (581 – 618 CE) and only had two emperors: Emperor
Wen and Emperor Yang. Both envisioned recapturing the glory of the Han Dynasty; hence, they
engaged in many construction projects and military campaigns. Immense capital cities were
built at Chang’an and Luoyang and, in order to supply them with sufficient grain, a canal system
was created to connect the Yellow River to the Yangzi River. These emperors also believed that
Manchuria and the Korean Peninsula were properly Chinese territory; therefore, they repeatedly
launched enormous military expeditions to attack the most powerful Korean kingdom located
there. Emperor Yang’s ground and naval campaign in 611 CE, for instance, required enlisting over
one million combat troops and hundreds of thousands
of additional men just to transport supplies. All of
these campaigns met defeat.
What is more, that very same year, the Yellow River
flooded, and rebellions broke out along it. Natural
disasters combined with these emperors’ heavy
demands led to widespread unrest, and the Sui Dynasty
unraveled. Bandit leaders, local officials, and local
elites took matters into their own hands by organizing
their communities for self-defense. After the emperor
took flight to the south, General Li Yuan [lee you-an],
who was stationed along the northern border to defend
against the steppe nomads, marched into Chang’an,
where he declared the founding of the Tang Dynasty
(618 – 907 CE). Emperor Yang’s life came to an end
when he was assassinated by his own men.
Like the Han Dynasty, the Tang was one of the
most dynamic and long-lived dynasties in China’s
history. That dynamism was made possible by how
effectively early Tang rulers consolidated the empire
internally and then engaged in military expansion (see
Map 4.16). Consolidating the empire required first reestablishing solid political, economic, and military
institutions. Fortunately, Tang rulers could draw
upon nearly a millennium of historical experience
going back to the Qin Dynasty, when a centralized
monarchical political system governing all of China
was first established. At the capital, Tang emperors
had at their disposal sophisticated ministries that in

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
turn oversaw a vast provincial and county administrative system. To serve in high office, a man
usually had to come from one of a small number of highly prestigious families with illustrious family
pedigrees. These families took pride in their superior education and manners and maintained
their exclusiveness by intermarrying. Thus, the Tang Dynasty was dominated by an aristocracy.
Nevertheless, some men from a larger pool of locally prominent families entered the civil service
based on merit, by graduating from colleges located at the capitals or succeeding at civil service
examinations (see Figure 4.15).
In earlier times, empires rarely flourished without a solid agricultural foundation and revenue
base. To ensure sufficient grain and labor service, Tang rulers believed that land must be equitably
distributed to farmers. So they implemented the equal fields system. In this system, each
family was to receive an equal plot of land (adjusted for terrain and productivity) for life, as well
as a smaller plot as a permanent possession. The former was for growing grain, and the latter, for

hemp and mulberry trees. In exchange, each farming family had to pay a tax in grain and cloth
and provide twenty days of labor service. To make this work, officials carried out censuses and
land surveys and periodically redistributed land. Of course, this system was quite onerous and
difficult to carry out in practice, but it did function well for about a century.
The Tang also flourished because special attention was paid to molding an orderly society
through the promulgation of sophisticated law codes. From ancient times, in China, law was viewed
as an expression of the will of the emperor, whose pronouncements defined illegal conduct and
proper punishments for it. Also, law was critically important to maintaining order, not only in the
social but also the natural world. Crimes committed both by subjects and the state could disturb
the cosmos and lead to natural disasters. Thus, law maintained social and cosmic harmony. That
is why codes were so important.
The Tang Code contains twelve sections, one addressing general principles, and the rest,
administrative and penal law. Most of the statutes define criminal offenses and the punishment
for each of them. The magistrate’s role, then, was primarily to investigate and determine precisely
the nature of the crime so that the proper punishment could be assigned. In Tang times, people
believed that the severity of punishment should be based on the relative status of the perpetrator
and victim. For instance, a crime committed against a
family member was more serious than one committed
against a stranger, and a crime committed against an
official was more serious than one committed against a
commoner. Within families, too, the status of members
mattered. Whereas a father could flog his son without
consequence, a son faced capital punishment should he
beat his father. In brief, Tang laws encoded the status
hierarchy and values of imperial Confucianism. The
most serious crimes were those committed against the
emperor, country, senior family members, and social
superiors. Nevertheless, those of higher status were held
accountable for their actions; a magistrate who failed to
justly administer the law faced punishment. In fact, Tang
monarchs were so concerned that justice might fail to be
upheld that they often proclaimed amnesties, nullifying
the sentences of all but the worst criminals.
Lastly, Tang rulers established a formidable military. At first, the army consisted of six hundred
militias stationed at headquarters located near the capitals and throughout the countryside, a
large standing army located at the capital, and frontier garrisons strung out along the northern
border. These forces were largely maintained by drawing men from a military population. That is,
Tang rulers relied on a large number of families that maintained military traditions and provided
sons for periods of service in lieu of paying taxes and providing labor service. As necessary, these
men could be assembled into expeditionary armies consisting of heavy cavalry and marching
infantry (see Figure 4.16).

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
Having laid these solid institutional foundations, the Tang Dynasty followed with military
expansion. Offensives waged to the north divided up and subdued powerful Turkic khans and
their confederations of steppe nomads. Tang imperial power was then projected deep into Central
Asia, Manchuria, and northern Vietnam, making China the most dominant country in East Asia
in the seventh and eighth centuries.
4.11.2 The Emergence of East Asia: The Case of Korea and Japan
In the introduction, we defined East Asia in both geographic and cultural terms, highlighting
Korea and Japan. East Asia first emerges as an identifiable cultural sphere during the Tang Dynasty.
By Tang times, kingdoms had already emerged on the Korean Peninsula and the main islands of
Japan, but it was during the Tang that ruling elites in both of these states made extensive efforts to
adapt components of the Chinese political, legal, and writing system, as well as of Chinese culture,
to their own societies.
4.11.2.1: Korea’s History from the Fourth Century BCE to 900 CE
We have already learned about China’s history from the Han Dynasty (203 BCE – 220 CE)
through the Period of Division (220 – 589 CE) and into the Tang Dynasty. During those same
centuries, the first states formed on the Korean Peninsula, and historians generally organize that
time into three periods: the early historical period (c. 400 BCE – 313 CE), Three Kingdoms
Period (313 – 668 CE), and the Silla Dynasty (668 – 892 CE).
By the fourth century BCE, the peninsula had already long been populated by peoples who
had migrated there from northeast Asia and settled into agricultural villages. These peoples were
not originally speakers of Chinese; rather, they spoke languages belonging to the Altaic language
family, which possibly includes Korean. This point is important because people unfamiliar
with East Asia sometimes think that the languages spoken by Chinese, Koreans, Japanese, and
Vietnamese are closely related, when in fact they are quite different. However, it is also important
to note that in ancient times throughout East Asia, the Chinese writing system was adopted by
literate elites for the purpose of writing their spoken languages. Only over time were native scripts
developed out of it.
The political picture for the early historical period is complex because the peninsula and
neighboring Manchuria looked like a mosaic of chiefdom confederations and petty kingdoms,
each governed by elite families living in walled towns. These polities first took shape during these
centuries. By the early centuries CE, three kingdoms extending from Manchuria to where Seoul
lies today (the capital of South Korea) covered the northern half, while the southern half was
divided up by confederations of chiefdoms. The most powerful kingdom was Goguryeo [Ko-gooryo] c. 37 BCE – 668 CE).
The Korean peninsula lies very close to China, with only Manchuria and the Yellow Sea dividing
the two states. Long before Korea’s early historical period, rulers of Chinese states had taken an
interest in controlling both trade routes leading into this region and the peoples living there. In
108 BCE, during the Han Dynasty, Emperor Wu even sent expeditions into Manchuria and Korea. 
Page | 150
He opened up a corridor leading
from China through Manchuria into
the peninsula and established four
commanderies to control the area
(see Map 4.17).
But Han China by no means
colonized the entirety of this
northeastern region. Kingdoms and
tribal confederations remained to the
east and south, most notably Goguryeo.
After the Han Dynasty collapsed,
northern China was in turmoil and
unable to control these frontiers. In
313 CE, King Mich’on of Goguryeo,
in an effort to expand the size of his
kingdom, seized Chinese territory.
That date marked the beginning of a
new stage in Korean history referred
to as the Three Kingdoms period
(313 CE – 668 CE).
The Three Kingdoms were
Goguryeo, Baekje [peck-jay], and
Silla [she-la] (see Map 4.18). Like
Goguryeo, the early histories of
Baekje and Silla date back to the
early historical period, during which
time they were consolidated from
southern chiefdom confederations
(see Map 4.17). Each kingdom was
dominated by a warrior elite composed of the ruling and aristocratic clans. For most of the Three
Kingdoms period, Goguryeo was the dominant military and political power, spreading its control
over much of Manchuria and northern Korea. During the fifth century CE, its capital was moved
to Pyongyang, site of a former Han Commandery. This move made this city–the capital of North
Korea today–important to Korean history. Murals on Goguryeo tombs located in the vicinity show
what this kingdom’s elites valued (see Figure 4.17). They are depicted as heavily-clad warriors
fighting on horseback with bows and arrows, and swords and halberds. A cosmos depicts guardian
spirits and nature gods belonging to a native Korean tradition of shamanism.
Given the geopolitical position of Korea, it is not surprising that all three kingdoms highly
valued martial traditions. First of all, they fought with each other for control over territory and resources on the peninsula. Secondly, positioned as Korea is between China and Japan, those states
often intruded upon peninsular conflicts. For all these reasons, Silla, Baekje, and Goguryeo monMap 4.17 | A map of Korea during the early historical period |
After 108 BCE, Han China established commanderies in Korea. Lelang
was one of them and was located where the capital of North Korea–
Pyongyang–is today. The most powerful neighboring kingdom was
Goguryeo. Mahan and Jinhan were southern tribal confederations.

archs readily borrowed ideas from China
that might benefit their realms and give
them more power. That borrowing included introducing elements of Chinese
political institutions and legal traditions,
as well as Buddhism and Confucianism.
All of these kingdoms sent students to
study in China and patronized Chinese
Buddhist monks and learned Confucians
who visited their courts. These visitors
were knowledgeable in many fields of
learning, including science and technology. As we have seen, Buddhism not
only promised salvation but also magical powers of healing, and rulers could
style themselves as living Buddhas. That
is why they sponsored the building of
temples and formation of a Buddhist religious order. Confucianism, on the other
hand, provided models of civility, courtly
etiquette, and bureaucratic governance
for ruling elites, and rulers could style
themselves in Chinese fashion as sovereign monarchs. Hence, Confucian academies were established to train students of
aristocratic families for service.
Towards the end of the Three
Kingdoms period, however, it was
not the great northeastern power of
Goguryeo that unified the Korean
Peninsula. This achievement went
to the Silla Dynasty and did so for
two reasons. First, Silla rulers were
particularly effective in using Chinese
political practices to centralize their
power. They adopted Chinese-style
titles, central government agencies,
and law codes; made Buddhism
a state-sponsored religion; and
established an academy for studying
Chinese classical texts, law, medicine,

and astronomy. Second, Silla monarchs built alliances with Tang emperors that worked to their
advantage. As we have seen, the Chinese Sui Dynasty fell because Sui rulers suffered terrible
defeats at the hands of the armies of the great kingdom of Goguryeo. Tang Dynasty rulers
continued the invasions but also failed. For that reason, they were open to building alliances with
Silla and combining their military forces. Together, they defeated Baekje in 660 and Goguryeo in
668. Much to the Tang emperor’s surprise, Silla then drove out Tang forces, preventing any efforts
on China’s part to control the Korean peninsula. The Silla Dynasty (668 – 892 CE) thus became
the first one to unify the peninsula (see Map 4.16).
In sum, Goguryeo and the Silla Dynasty were, in succession, two of the most powerful kingdoms
in ancient Korea. Their histories were deeply shaped by the intrusion of Chinese states into the
region. For that reason, they can be categorized as instances of secondary state formation.
Throughout history, some states developed and centralized their control over a territory largely in
response to the impact of a powerful neighboring state that had developed before them. As they
did so, they also borrowed ideas for how states should be organized from that neighboring power,
even as native traditions and language are retained.
4.11.2.2 Japan from the Yayoi Period to the Seventh Century
Those who follow the history of World War II might know that, during those years, the highest
authority in Japan was Emperor Hirohito. Even today, Japan has an emperor and empress, although
they no longer have any formal political power in this now democratic nation and rather serve in
a cultural and symbolic role. Interestingly, the Japanese monarchy is the oldest continuous one in
the history of the world and traces its beginnings
to at least the fourth century CE.
Japan’s early historical development presents
unique characteristics because of its geography.
The island archipelago was close enough to
Chinese and Korean states to borrow from them
and benefit from migration and yet far enough
away so that invasions were never a sudden
impetus to change (see Map 4.1). Therefore,
although we can also speak of secondary state
formation for Japan, that is largely because of
the conscious choice on the part of ruling elites
to adopt political ideas and cultural patterns
from China and Korea.
But even during the prehistoric period,
geography impacted Japan’s development in
other ways. The first evidence for Paleolithic
hunter-gatherers dates back to c. 30,000 BCE. In
the resource-rich environments of mountainous
and forested Japan, small bands of mobile,

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
multi-generational families were able to thrive on game, shellfish, fruits, tubers, and nuts. In fact,
foraging strategies were so successful that even when sedentary village communities first formed,
they thrived without agriculture. This period of time is known as the Jōmon [joe-moan] Period
(c. 11,000 – 500 BCE). The archaeological record reveals that, up and down the archipelago,
foragers had settled into permanent base camps. These were hamlet communities made up of
pit dwellings for homes and raised floor structures for holding community functions. Jōmon,
meaning “cord-marked,” refers to the type of pottery they used (see Figure 4.18). This case is one
of the few in prehistory where a culture invented and used pottery long before farming.
Farming began during the next stage in Japanese history–the Yayoi [ya-yo-ee] Period (500
BCE – 250 CE). The label refers to a site near Tokyo where artifacts were discovered evidencing
new developments in Japan. Most importantly, rice-paddy agriculture and dry-field farming were
introduced, techniques that supported population growth and the formation of more and larger village
communities. The impetus to agriculture was likely earlier experimentation with simple horticulture,
a warming climate, and migration from mainland East Asia. Those migrants also brought knowledge
of iron- and bronze-working; hence, tools and weapons fashioned from metals became widespread.
During the early centuries of Yayoi, small village communities proliferated across the main islands
of Japan, but, during the latter half, they evolved into something more substantial. Archaeologists
have excavated the foundations of large settlements surrounded by moats and embankments (see
Figure 4.19). These fortified bastions were home to up to two thousand residents and contained
ceremonial centers, differentiated residences and burials, watchtowers, and palisades. Some

burials contained skeletons evidencing wounds or
dismemberment. Combining this evidence with
clues from contemporary Chinese historical sources,
specialists have concluded that, by the end of the
Yayoi period, powerful chiefdoms had emerged in
Japan, and they were allying with and battling each
other to control trade routes and territory.
In retrospect, the late Yayoi Period clearly was
a transitional phase leading to the formation of the
first kingdom in Japanese history. That happened
in the next stage, the Mounded Tomb Period
(250 – 600 CE). Among the warring chiefdoms,
one emerged as dominant. Hailing from the
Kinai region of Japan (see Map 4.1), Yamato
chieftains expanded their power through force
and diplomacy, and eventually forged a kingdom
(see Map 4.19). The principal evidence
for their growing power are the massive,
keyhole-shaped tombs giving this period its
name (see Figure 4.20). In fact, nearly ten
thousand tombs have been identified, but
the largest ones belong to the Yamato rulers,
the ancestors to the long-lived Japanese
imperial line. Although the large royal ones
have not yet been excavated, smaller tombs
containing an abundance of horse trappings,
iron weapons, and armor provide evidence
that mounted warfare was introduced from
the Korean peninsula, perhaps accelerating
the pace of state formation.
As they conquered more territory, Yamato
rulers devised strategies for strengthening
their monarchy and incorporating leaders of
the many powerful chieftain clans dominating
local areas up and down the archipelago. For
service at their royal court or as provincial
officials, they granted them office and noble
titles, thereby building a coalition of great
clans. In addition, in the sixth century CE,

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
Yamato rulers began to study
the great Sui (581 – 618 CE)
and Tang (618 – 907 CE)
Dynasties in China and to
introduce reforms based upon
what they learned. The next two
centuries in Japanese history,
the Asuka-Nara Period (c.
600 – 800 CE), was defined by
these Chinese-style reforms,
although the name itself refers
to the successive locations of
the royal court.
Prince Shōtoku [showtoe-coo] (573 – 621 CE) and
Empress Suiko [sue-ee-ko]
(r. 593 – 628) led the way by
sending several embassies
to the capital of China and
then remodeling their capital
and court. In his “Seventeen
Article Constitution,” Shōtoku called for the introduction of Buddhism and Confucian ethics.
His articles, for instance, stated that the sovereign’s relation to subjects was like Heaven’s
to the earth, and his or her commands should thus be obeyed. Empress Suiko adopted the
title “Heavenly Monarch,” thus shifting the character of the monarch from a martial king to
a Chinese-style sovereign. In brief, they introduced a Confucian-oriented, emperor-centered
state ideology that clearly established a hierarchical system of ranks and norms for court
etiquette. For the remainder of this period, other reformers and monarchs would only deepen
the reforms by introducing Chinese-style law codes. These laws reshaped the government and
land according to a bureaucratic and administrative structure very similar to that of Tang China.
Nevertheless, distinctly Japanese patterns remained throughout this time. First, the
royally-recognized great clans of earlier times evolved into an aristocratic class that dominated
the court and the upper ranks of officialdom. Secondly, in addition to establishing a council to
manage the growing numbers of Buddhist temples and clerics, the court established a Council
of Kami Affairs to oversee native Japanese religious traditions. That tradition is known as
Shinto [sheen-toe], or the “Way of the Kami.”
Shinto began in prehistoric times as reverence for kami—spirits and deities associated
with natural phenomena, such as the sun or moon. Really, anything mysterious might become
a kami, including a mountain, charismatic ruler, or serpent. During the Yayoi and Mounded
Tomb Periods, these kami became the subjects of myths that explained their origins and powers,
and shrines were erected to house sacred objects symbolizing them. By properly purifying

first emperors. The shrine has been rebuilt many times

oneself, conducting rituals, and praying to a kami, an individual could avert a disaster and
ensure his own or the community’s well-being. Also, clans would claim important kami as
their guardian spirits and fashion stories about how their ancestors descended from them. In
fact, Yamato monarchs claimed they were descended from the Sun Goddess Amaterasu, and
constructed a shrine at Ise [ee-say] to house her kami body (see Figure 4.21). Finally, during
the Asuka-Nara Period, the Yamato court developed a centralized system to keep track of and
regulate Shinto shrines throughout its realm, thereby harnessing higher powers to support its
claim to rule the land.
In sum, like Korea, Japan’s history was highly impacted by developments in China, even
as native languages, traditions, and creative adaptation remained foundational to the unique
identities of each. However, Korea was far more subject to the intrusion of Chinese states in the
Korean Peninsula, something that did not happen in Japan. Rather, as the first state formed on
the archipelago, ruling elites looked to China for ideas as to how the kingdom might be governed.
In the course of doing so, they also introduced the great tradition of Mahayana Buddhism.
4.11.3 The Decline and Collapse of the Tang Dynasty
The Tang Dynasty reached its zenith during the eighth century under the reign of Emperor
Xuanzong (r. 712 – 756 CE), but then went into decline. At first, the problem was overexpansion.
Tang rulers had expanded the empire’s boundaries in nearly every direction, including far into
Central Asia. To defend the northwestern border, a system of regional frontier commands was
established, each with its own commander and professional army. The earlier system of militias
and garrisons manned by hereditary military families declined.
This decline turned out to be dangerous. After one general, An Lushan, butted heads with the
emperor’s chief minister, he marched his frontier army of 100,000 soldiers south to the capital,
forcing the court to flee. An was eventually executed by his own men, and a Tang emperor returned
to the throne, but the turmoil unleashed by this rebellion rendered the Tang Dynasty ineffective.
During the ensuing turmoil, the empire shrank and Central Asia was lost (see Map 4.20). Also,
both Tang supporters and pardoned rebels were granted military governorships, giving them
control over provinces. Many then chose not to remit tax revenue to the central government,
appointed their own subordinates, and designated their successors. They had, in effect, become
warlords with their own loyal, regional bases.
Furthermore, as the political system decentralized in this way, the system of equitable
land distribution collapsed. Thus, much like during the end of the Han Dynasty, landlords
used their power and influence to build great estates. Large numbers of farmers ended up
without land and survived only by joining bandit gangs or the ranks of warlord armies. When
droughts and famine hit in the late ninth century, a massive rebellion broke out. The last
Tang emperor was turned into a puppet by military commanders and eventually, in 907 CE,
abdicated. China then entered yet another period of division until the Song Dynasty restored
order in 960 CE.

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
4.12 THE SONG DYNASTY
Like every Chinese dynasty before it, the Song Dynasty (960 – 1279 CE) was born out of
turmoil and warfare. After the Tang Dynasty fell, China was once again divided up by numerous,
contending kingdoms. The founder of the Song, Zhao Kuangyin [j-ow kwong-yeen], was a
military commander and advisor to the emperor of one of these kingdoms, but after he died and
his six-year-old son came to the throne, Zhao staged a coup. He left the capital with his troops,
ostensibly to fight enemies to the north. But just outside the capital, his troops instead proclaimed
him emperor, a title he accepted only with feigned reluctance and after his followers promised
obedience and to treat the child emperor and people living in the capital environs humanely. On
February 3, 960, the child was forced to abdicate, and Zhao took the throne as Emperor Taizu [tiedzoo]. He and his brother, the succeeding Emperor Taizong [tie-dzawng], ruled for the first forty
years of a dynasty that would last over three hundred, laying the foundations for its prosperity
and cultural brilliance. The Song Dynasty saw a total of eighteen emperors and is most notable for

the challenges it faced from northern conquest dynasties, economic prosperity, a civil service
examination system and the educated elite of scholar-officials it created, cultural brilliance,
and footbinding.
During the Song, China once again confronted tremendous challenges from conquests by
military confederations located along the northern border. So threatening and successful were
these that the Song Dynasty counted as just one of many powerful players in a larger geopolitical
system in Central and East Asia. The first two northern conquest dynasties, the Liao [lee-ow]
and Jin [jean], emerged on the plains of Manchuria when powerful tribal leaders organized
communities of hunters, fishers, and farmers for war (see Map 4.21).
As their power grew, they formed states and conquered territory in northern China, forcing
the Chinese to pay them large subsidies of silk and silver for peace. So Chinese rulers and
their councilors were in constant negotiations with peoples they viewed as culturally-inferior
barbarians under conditions where they were forced to treat them as equals, as opposed to weaker

tribute-paying states in a Chinese-dominated world. At first, they used a combination of defensive
measures and expensive bilateral treaties, which did make for a degree of stability. But a high
price was exacted. Halfway through the Song, the Jin Dynasty destroyed the Liao and occupied the
entire northern half of China, forcing the Song court to move south (see Map 4.22). To rule Chinese
possessions, Jin rulers even took on the trappings of Chinese-style emperors and developed a dual
administrative system. Steppe tribes were ruled by a traditional military organization, while the
farming population of China was governed with Chinese-style civilian administration. The Song
Dynasty thus constantly faced the prospect of extinction and was challenged in its legitimacy by
rival emperors claiming the right to rule the Chinese realm.
One reason Song monarchs were able to buy peace was the extraordinary prosperity during
their rule and the resulting tax revenue made available. During those centuries, China was by many
measures the most developed country in the world. In 1100 CE, the population was one hundred
million, more than all of medieval Europe combined. That number doubled the population of

750 CE, just three hundred years prior. The reason for such growth was flourishing agricultural
production, especially rice-paddy agriculture. More drought-resistant and earlier-ripening strains
of rice, combined with better technology, lead to higher yields per acre.
The impact was enormous. The productivity of farmers stimulated other industries, such
as ironworking. Estimates place iron production at as high as twenty thousand tons per year.
That amount made iron prices low and, therefore, such products as spades, ploughshares, nails,
axles, and pots and pans more cheaply available. Seeing its profitability, wealthy landowning and
merchant families invested in metallurgy, spurring better technology. Bellows, for instance, were
worked by hydraulic machinery, such as water mills. Explosives derived from gunpowder were
engineered to open mines. Similar development of textile and ceramic industries occurred.
Indeed, during the Song, China underwent a veritable economic revolution. Improvements in
agriculture and industry, combined with a denser population, spurred the commercialization
of the economy. A commercialized economy is one that supports the pursuit of profit through
production of specialized products for markets. A Song farmer, for instance, as opposed to just
producing rice to get by, might rather purchase it on a market and instead specialize in tea or
oranges. Since markets were proliferating in towns and cities and transport via land and water
was now readily available, farmers could rely on merchants to market their goods across the
country. To support this economic activity, the government minted billions of coins each year as
well as the world’s first paper currency.
A denser population and sophisticated economy led to urbanization. During the Song, at a
time when London had roughly fifteen thousand people, China had dozens of cities with over fifty
thousand people and capitals with a half million. Song painted scrolls show crowds of people moving
through streets lined with shops, restaurants, teahouses, and guest houses (see Figure 4.22).

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
To manage their realm, Song rulers implemented a national civil service examination
to recruit men for office. Prior dynasties had used written examinations testing knowledge of
Confucian classics to select men for office, but only as a supplement to recommendation and
hereditary privilege. During the collapse of the Tang Dynasty, however, aristocratic families
that had for centuries dominated the upper echelons of officialdom disappeared. The first Song
emperor, Zhao Kuangyin, rode to power with the support of military men; having largely unified
China, he then sought to restore civil governance based in Confucian principles of humaneness
and righteousness. So he invited senior commanders to a party and, over a cup of wine, asked them
to relinquish their commands for a comfortable retirement. They obliged. He and his successors
consequently made the examination system the pre-eminent route to office, even establishing a
national school system to help young men prepare for and advance through it. Thus, during the
Song Dynasty, civil offices came to be dominated by men who had spent years, even decades,
preparing for and passing through a complex series of exams. Hence, they were both scholars and
officials. Success in entering this class placed a person at the pinnacle of society, guaranteeing
them prestige and wealth. These scholar-officials, and their Confucian worldview, dominated
Chinese society until the twentieth century.
In theory, since any adult male could take the examinations, the system was meritocratic.
But in reality, because they were so difficult and quotas were set, very few actually passed them.
Estimates suggest that only one in one hundred passed the lowest level exam. This ratio meant
that, in order to succeed, a young man had to begin memorizing long classical texts as a child
and to continue his studies until he passed or gave up hope. Only affluent families could afford to
support such an education.
Nevertheless, the meritocratic ideal inspired people from all classes to try and so promoted literacy
and a literary revival during the Song Dynasty. As a part of this revival and to provide a curriculum
for education, scholar-officials sought to reinvigorate Confucianism. The philosophical movement
they began is known as Neo-Confucianism. By the Song Dynasty, whereas Confucianism largely
shaped personal behavior and social mores, Buddhist and Daoist explanations of the cosmos,
human nature, and the human predicament dominated the individual’s spiritual outlook. NeoConfucians responded to this challenge by providing a metaphysical basis for Confucian morality
and governance. Zhu Xi (1130 – 1200), arguably the most important philosopher in later imperial
Chinese history, produced a grand synthesis that would shape the worldview of the scholar-official
class. He argued that the cosmos consists of a duality of principles and a material force composing
physical things. One principle underlies the cosmos and individual principles provide the abstract
reason for individual things. In human beings, principle manifests as human nature, which is wholly
good and the origins of the human capacity to become moral persons. However, an individual’s
physical endowment obscures their good nature and leads to moral failings, which is why a rigorous
Confucian curriculum of moral self-cultivation based in classical texts like Confucius’ Analects is
necessary. Most importantly, Zhu Xi argued, individual morality was the starting point for producing
a well-managed family, orderly government, and peace throughout the world.
Furthermore, during the Song Dynasty, moveable-type printing also began to be widely used,
contributing to an increase in literacy and broader exposure to these new ideas. Chinese characters 
Page | 162
were carved on wood blocks, which were
then arranged in boxes that could be
dipped in ink and printed on paper (see
Figure 4.23). Books on a multitude of
topics–especially classics and histories–
became cheaply and widely available,
fueling a cultural efflorescence at a time
when education had become paramount
to climbing the social ladder. Other
inventions that made China one of the
most technologically innovative during
this time include gunpowder weapons (see
Figure 4.24) and the mariner’s compass.
Looked at from many angles, then,
the Song was truly a dynamic period in
China’s history. However, some observers
have bemoaned the fact that footbinding
began during this dynasty and see that
practice as a symbol of increasing gender
oppression. Scholars believe footbinding
began among professional dancers in the tenth century and was then adopted by the upper classes.
Over time it spread to the rest of Chinese society, only to end in the twentieth century. At a young age,
a girl’s feet would be wrapped tightly with bandages so that they couldn’t grow, ideally remaining
about four-inches long. That stunting made walking very difficult and largely kept women confined
to their homes. Eventually, the bound foot, encased in an embroidered silk slipper, became a symbol

of femininity and also one of the criteria
for marriageability (see Figure 4.25).
More generally, social norms and the
law did place women in a subordinate
position. Whereas men dominated
public realms like government and
business, women married at a young age
and lived out most of their lives in the
domestic sphere. Indeed, in earlier times,
China was patriarchal, patrilineal, and
patrilocal. It was patriarchal because the
law upheld the authority of senior males
in the household and patrilineal because
one’s surname and family property passed
down the male line—though a wife did
have control over her dowry. Importantly,
ancestor worship, the pre-eminent social
and religious practice in Chinese society,
was directed toward patrilineal forbears.
That is why it was important for the
woman to move into the spouse’s home,
where she would live together with her
parents-in-law. Patrilocal describes this
type of social pattern. Marriages were
almost always arranged for the benefit of
both families involved, and, during the
wedding ceremony, the bride was taken in
a curtained sedan chair to the husband’s
home where she was to promise to obey her
parents-in-law and then bow along with
her husband before the ancestral altar.
Ideally, she would become a competent
household manager, educate the children,
and demonstrate much restraint and
other excellent interpersonal skills.
Although gender hierarchy was,
therefore, the norm, other scholars have
observed that ideals were not always
reality and women did exercise their
agency within the boundaries placed
upon them. A wife could gain dignity

and a sense of self-worth by handling
her roles capably; she would also earn
respect. Song literature further reveals
that women were often in the fields
working or out on city streets shopping.
Among the upper classes, literacy and
the ability to compose essays or poetry
made a woman more marriageable. For
this reason, some women were able to
excel. Li Qingzhao [lee ching-jow] (c.
1084 – 1155) is one of China’s greatest
poets (see Figure 4.27). She came from
a prestigious scholar-official family. Her
father was both a statesman and classical
scholar, and her mother was known for
her literary achievements. In her teens,
Li began to compose poetry, and, over
the course of her life, she produced many
volumes of essays and poems. Poems to
her husband even suggest mutual love
and respect and treating her as an equal.
In fact, throughout Chinese history, it
was not unusual for women to challenge
and transgress boundaries. At the highest
level, during both the Han and Tang
Dynasties, we find cases of empress
dowagers dominating youthful heirs
to the throne and even one case of an
empress declaring her own dynasty.
4.13 THE YUAN DYNASTY
The last major dynasty prior to China’s early modern period is the Yuan [you-an] Dynasty. Like
earlier neighbors lying to the north of the Song, the Yuan was also a northern conquest dynasty. The
key players here were steppe nomads living on the grasslands of Mongolia, known as Mongols, and
their leader Genghis Khan. The story of their rise and how they created the largest territorial empire
in the history of the world properly belongs to Chapter Eleven, which covers Central Asia, so we here
only provide a brief introduction. The most important point to bear in mind is that the Mongols
conquered many countries, including China, and incorporated them into a large Eurasian empire.
In the twelfth century CE, the Mongols were one of many tribes of nomadic pastoralists living
on the steppes of Central Asia. Although these tribes were made up of peoples of differing ethnicity,

CHAPTER 4: CHINA AND EAST ASIA TO THE MING DYNASTY
they held in common a way of life. Since the steppe was unsuited to farming, they relied principally
on their herds, but also on what they could obtain by trading with neighboring sedentary peoples.
The nomads lived in temporary campsites, periodically breaking down their yurts and relocating
as the seasons required. Since the tribes often fought with each other or turned to raiding, nomads
were also excellent at mounted warfare. Their chieftain leaders–referred to as khans–were usually
selected based on skill in battle and charisma.
Undoubtedly, the most famous khan in Central Asian history is Genghis Khan. In the late twelfth
century, he accrued an army of loyal followers and began to subdue tribes across the Mongolian
steppe. In 1206 CE, at a gathering of tribal leaders, he was proclaimed Universal Khan of a tribal
confederation. Using a powerful military with a tight command structure, Genghis proceeded to
unleash a wave of campaigning in northern China and Central Asia, thereby adding much territory
to a growing Mongol Empire (see Map 4.23). After he died in 1227 CE, this empire was divided into
four khanates, each of which went to one of his four sons as their territorial inheritance.
Tolui, Genghis Khan’s youngest son, was granted the Mongol homeland as well as subjugated
territory in northern China held by the Jin Dynasty. But this rugged warrior died in 1232 at the young

age of forty, so the task of managing Chinese territory fell to
Tolui’s capable wife Sorghagtani Beki and her second son,
Kublai Khan (1215 – 1294 CE). Unlike his predecessors,
who largely treated Chinese as chattel and ruthlessly
exploited their towns and villages, Kublai saw the advantages
of taking a more enlightened approach. With the advice of
Chinese advisors, he adopted Chinese-style methods for
governing China. In fact, after Kublai was elected as the fifth
Universal Khan in 1260, he chose to move his capital from
Mongolia to Beijing, making it the center of his khanate. He
then took on the trappings of a Chinese-style sovereign and,
in 1273, declared the founding of the Great Yuan Dynasty.
Accordingly, he asserted that the Mandate of Heaven had
been transferred to him from the Song Dynasty.
Kublai then engaged in a decade of conquest that
concluded with the fall of the Song. This victory over the
Song Dynasty, China required careful preparation. The
Song was located in the southern two-thirds of China,
where the terrain was matted with lakes, rivers, and canals.
The Mongols had little experience with naval warfare, so they turned to Chinese advisors to build
a navy. Mongol cavalry boarded the ships and floated down rivers leading to the Song capital,
laying siege to cities along the way. When they reached it in 1276, Kublai’s generals took the
capital without bloodshed. The regent to the young
Song emperor worked out conditions for surrender
to them. Hence, the Mongol Yuan Dynasty had won
control over China. After Kublai died, nine of his
descendants ruled as emperors until the dynasty fell
to native rebellions in 1368.
Historians differently assess the impact of
Mongol Yuan rule on China. Earlier generations of
historians judged that violent Mongol conquests
devastated the land and led to a population drop.
The Mongol style of rule was despotic. Rather than
sustain the openness of Chinese society and use the
merit-based examination system to bring talent into
their government, Mongol rulers placed Chinese
in rigid occupational categories and suspended the
exams. Many capable men simply avoided official
service and turned to other professions.
Recent studies, however, offer a more positive
assessment. Because Yuan rulers followed the

counsel of Confucian advisors and adopted traditional Chinese methods for governing, for
most Chinese life went on as before. Early on, much attention was also paid to the farming
population. To promote agriculture, Yuan rulers provided relief measures and promoted the
formation of rural cooperatives. Also, Mongols highly valued crafts and implemented policies
that greatly benefited artisans and promoted their work. Hence, arts such as textiles and ceramics
flourished (see Figure 4.28). Finally, the assessment of Yuan rule in China should be linked to a
broader assessment of the impact of Mongol rule on world history (see Chapter Eleven). While
duly acknowledging the devastation caused by Mongol conquests, historians also find much merit
in Mongol patronage of arts and support for constructions projects and advancements in the areas
of medicine and astronomy. Most importantly, the massive Eurasian empire they forged initiated
a new era of trade and contacts between Europe and China, as well as the regions lying between.
4.14 CONCLUSION
We have now passed through nearly four millennia of East Asian history. We prefaced that history
with the development of Neolithic cultures leading up to the second millennium BCE, at which point
the first kingdoms in Chinese history emerged. Longshan culture (3000 – 1900 BCE) consisted of
competing chiefdoms that laid the foundations for the emergence of the first major states.
The first major state was the Xia Dynasty (c. 1900 – 1600 BCE). Although historians debate
whether or not it was legendary and lack written sources from that time, the archaeological
evidence points to a Bronze Age civilization with a capital city at Erlitou. The next dynasty, the
Shang (c. 1600 – 1046 BCE), brings us into history proper, because we have written evidence in
the form of oracle bones and bronze inscriptions. The last Shang capital was located at Anyang
on the North China Plain near the Yellow River. The dynasty’s most important legacies were the
earliest form of Chinese writing and ancestor worship. The oracle bones were used to divine the
will of higher powers and the spirits of deceased Shang kings.
The next dynasty, the Zhou Dynasty (1045 – 256 BCE), began when chieftains to the west of
the Shang declared themselves kings and overthrew it. They justified doing so with the Mandate
of Heaven, which states that a higher power withdraws its support from corrupt ruling families
and transfers it to righteous ones. Because it lasted eight hundred years and saw much change,
the Zhou is divided into two major periods, the Western (1045 – 771 BCE) and Eastern Zhou
(770 – 256 BCE). During the Western Zhou, Zhou kings ruled by granting land and noble titles
to kinsmen and allies in exchange for loyalty and service. The resulting political system, which
saw China divided up by over one hundred feudal states, is known as Zhou feudalism. During the
Eastern Zhou, this nobility became increasingly independent and fought with each other for power
and territory. A few declared themselves kings and forged powerful militaries by gearing their
kingdoms for war. In the end, in 221 BCE, the state of Qin prevailed, initiating China’s imperial
era. Also, in the midst of the dislocation caused by Eastern Zhou instability, three of China’s major
philosophical traditions emerged: Confucianism, Legalism, and Daoism.
The short-lived Qin Dynasty was followed by the much longer lasting Han Dynasty (202 BCE
– 220 CE). During the Han Dynasty, Confucianism was adopted as the governing philosophy and 
Page | 168
also penetrated society, shaping the Chinese worldview. The Han also became an empire, as borders
were expanded in all directions. During the reign of Emperor Wu (141 – 87 BCE), China extended
control over parts of Korea, northern Vietnam, and also much of Central Asia. The resulting stability
and the productivity of the economy spurred the development of the Silk Routes.
After the Han dynasty fell, China was divided up by independent, short-lived kingdoms until
589 CE, when the Sui Dynasty reunited most of the territory once controlled by the Han. Thus,
for four centuries, during what is known as the Period of Division (220 – 589 CE), China was
politically unstable and racked by endemic warfare. Yet, in spite of the violence, these centuries
also saw vibrant cultural developments, as Buddhism became an organized institutional religion
reshaping the spiritual landscape.
The Tang Dynasty (618 – 907 CE) was yet another long-lived one in Chinese history. Tang
rulers built an empire on the foundations of solid political and legal institutions, agricultural
policy, and a formidable military. Also during the Tang Dynasty, East Asia first emerged as an
identifiable cultural sphere. By Tang times, kingdoms had already formed on the Korean Peninsula
and the main islands of Japan, but it was during the Tang that ruling elites in both of these states
made extensive efforts to adapt components of the Chinese political, legal, and writing system, as
well as of Chinese culture, to their own societies. During the seventh century CE, the Silla Dynasty
unified the Korean Peninsula, and the Yamato heavenly sovereigns unified much of Japan. Two
other unique East Asian civilizations had taken shape.
The last major dynasty surveyed was the Song Dynasty (960 – 1279 CE), one that is notable
for the challenges it faced from northern conquest dynasties, its economic prosperity, and the
civil service examination system and the educated elite of scholar-officials it created. Also, since
footbinding developed during the Song, we considered the status of women in Chinese society,
where gender hierarchy was the norm.
The Song Dynasty ended with Mongol conquests in 1279 CE. The Mongol Yuan Dynasty made
China one part of a much larger Eurasian territorial empire. Mongol ruled lasted until 1368 CE,
when native rebellions overthrew a faltering Yuan state, initiating a new period in Chinese history:
the Ming Dynasty. This dynasty properly belongs to early modern history. 


5.5 GEOGRAPHY AND TOPOGRAPHY
This chapter’s title refers to the Greek World, rather than Greece. While Greece is a unified
country today, the territory of the present-day country was not unified under one rule until the
rise of the Macedonians in the fourth century BCE. Instead, the basic unit of organization in the
period covered in this chapter was the polis, an independent city-state, which consisted of a
walled city that controlled and protected the farmland around it. Historians estimate that close to
1,500 of these city-states dotted the ancient Greek landscape.
Each of these poleis (plural form of polis) possessed its own form of government, law-code,
army, cults of patron gods, and overall culture that set it apart from the other city-states. While
the two most famous poleis, Athens and Sparta, controlled vast territories of farmland, most
city-states were quite small, with a population of just a few thousand citizens. Furthermore, the
Greek world in antiquity encompassed much more than present-day Greece, extending as far as
Italy in the West and the territories of modern-day Turkey and Ukraine in the East.
The geography and topography of the Greek mainland and the Mediterranean region
surrounding it influenced the history of the Greek people in a number of crucial ways. First, the
mountainous nature of mainland Greece, especially in the north, allowed different regions to remain
somewhat isolated. The most isolated of all, Thessaly and Macedon, were viewed as uncivilized
barbarians by the rest of the Greeks in the Archaic and Classical periods (one oft-mentioned
example of their “barbarism” in Greek literature is that they drank their wine undiluted!)and
largely kept to themselves until their rise to military prominence in the mid-fourth century BCE.
The mountains throughout the northern portion of mainland Greece, in addition to isolating
regions from each other and promoting regional culture, also provided tactical defenses in the
face of external attacks. Most famously, the Persians learned the hard way about the challenges of
navigating the Greek landscape during the second Persian invasion of Greece in 480 BCE. Indeed,
the story of the 300 Spartans who fought to the death at the Battle of Thermopylae addresses
the challenge of the Persian army trying to cross the mountains to the north of Attica in order to
invade Athens by land.
The Isthmus, a narrow strip of land controlled by Corinth, played a similar role in separating
mainland Greece from the large peninsula of the Peloponnese. An inland city in southern

Peloponnese, Sparta conquered Messenia, its surrounding region, early in its history and
extended political control over much of the peninsula by early fifth century BCE. Unless the
interests of Sparta herself were directly involved, Sparta practiced a policy of isolation and limited
military intervention in other city-states affairs and wars, a practice enabled due to Sparta’s far
southern location in Peloponnese.
No less influential for the history of the Greek city-states than the topographical features were the
resources that the land in different regions provided for agriculture and manufacturing. Mainland
Greece was notoriously unsuitable for agriculture. Growing the grain staples wheat and barley in the
rocky and clay-filled soil of Athens was especially difficult, while the mountainous regions across the
entire mainland were optimal for herding, rather than agriculture. One notable exception, however,

were olive trees, which grew abundantly.
Olive oil, as a result, was ubiquitously used
for eating, bathing, and lamps, and even
as currency or prize for victors in athletic
games. In addition, early on in their history,
the inhabitants of Attica and Corinth found
a way to profit from the clay in their soil by
developing advanced ceramic pot-making and
decorating techniques. Remains of Athenian
and Corinthian wares have been found at
archaeological sites all over the Mediterranean,
attesting to their popularity abroad.
Finally, precious metals were in short
supply in the mainland, but the few that were
available had an impact on the history of their
regions. Most famously, the discovery of the
silver mines at Laurion in Attica contributed
to the increased prosperity of Athens in the
mid-fifth century BCE.

tells us a part of the story. The Aegean is filled with islands, some of which remained autonomous,
but most came under the control of the Athenian maritime empire in the fifth century BCE. In
addition, the Greek colonization movement of the seventh and sixth centuries BCE resulted
in the foundation of numerous Greek city-states in Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), Magna
Graecia (southern Italy), Sicily, and the Black Sea littoral.
The history of the Greek world from its earliest settlements to the Roman conquest, therefore,
is inextricably tied together with the history of the Mediterranean as a whole. And since the Greek
areas of influence overlapped with those controlled by the Phoenicians, Persians, and eventually
the Romans, interactions, often warlike, were unavoidable as well. As the modern historians
Peregrine Horden and Nicholas Purcell noted, the Mediterranean was “the Corrupting Sea”1whose
inhabitants were like frogs around the pond, watching each other, and borrowing each other’s
cultural and technological achievements. As this chapter and the next will show, the Greeks and
the Romans were the farthest-leaping frogs of all.
5.6 PERIODS OF GREEK HISTORY
Historians today separate Greek history into particular periods, which shared specific features
throughout the Greek world:
The Bronze Age (c. 3,300 – 1,150 BCE) – a period characterized by the use of bronze
tools and weapons. In addition, two particular periods during the Bronze Age are crucial in the
development of early Greece: the Minoan Age on the island of Crete (c. 2,000 – 1,450 BCE) and
the Mycenean period on mainland Greece (c. 1,600 – 1,100 BCE), both of them characterized
by massive palaces, remnants of which still proudly stand today. The Minoan and Mycenaean
civilizations had writing (dubbed Linear A and Linear B, respectively), which they used for
keeping lists and palace inventories.
The Dark Ages (c. 1,100 – 700 BCE) – a period that is “dark” from the archaeological
perspective, which means that the monumental palaces of the Mycenean period disappear, and the
archaeological record reveals a general poverty and loss of culture throughout the Greek world. For
instance, the Linear A and Linear B writing systems disappear. The Greeks do not rediscover writing
until the invention of the Greek alphabet at the end of the Dark Ages or the early Archaic Period.
Archaic Period (c. 700 – 480 BCE) – the earliest period for which written evidence survives;
this is the age of the rise of the Greek city-states, colonization, and the Persian Wars.
Classical Period (c. 480 – 323 BCE) – the period from the end of the Persian Wars to the
death of Alexander the Great. One of the most important events during this period is the
Peloponnesian War (431 – 404 BCE), which pitted Athens against Sparta, and forced all other Greek
city-states to choose to join one side or the other. This period ends with the death of Alexander the
Great, who had unified the Greek world into a large kingdom with himself at its helm.
Hellenistic Period (323 – 146 BCE) – the period from the death of Alexander to the
Roman conquest of Greece; this is the age of the Hellenistic monarchies ruling over territories
previously conquered by Alexander and his generals. Some historians end this period in 30

BCE, with the death of Cleopatra VII, the last surviving ruler of Egypt who was a descendant
of one of Alexander’s generals.
The rest of this chapter will be devoted to examining each of these periods in greater detail,
covering chief political, military, and cultural developments.
5.7 METHODOLOGY: SOURCES AND PROBLEM
Before launching into the story of the early Greek world, it is important to consider the
methodology that Greek historians utilize. In other words, how do we know what we know about
the Greek world? Modern scholars of ancient history are notoriously obsessed with evaluating
their primary sources critically, and with good reason. Studying Greek history, especially in its
earliest periods, is like putting together a puzzle, most of whose pieces are missing, and some
pieces from another puzzle have also been added in for good measure. Greek history requires
careful consideration of a wide range of sources, which fall into two broad categories: literary
sources (including both fiction and non-fiction), and material culture. The job of the historian,
then, is to reconstruct the story of the Greek people using these very different sources.
While historians of the modern world rely on such archival sources as newspapers, magazines,
and personal diaries and correspondence of individuals and groups, historians of the ancient
world must use every available source to reconstruct the world in which their subject dwelled.
Literary sources, such as epics, lyric poetry, and drama, may seem strange for historians to use,
as they do not necessarily describe specific historical events. Yet, as in the case of other early
civilizations, such sources are a crucial window into the culture and values of the people who
produced them. For instance, the Epic of Gilgamesh, discussed in Chapter 2, is a key text for the
study of early Mesopotamia.
The earliest literary sources for Greek history are the Homeric epics, Iliad and Odyssey. They
are, however, one of the most challenging sources to interpret, with one modern historian dubbing
them a “historian’s headache.”2 Composed orally before the existence of the Greek alphabet, the
epics were not written down until sometime in the sixth century BCE. The epics most likely do
not reflect the society of any particular Greek city-state in any one period, but rather consist of an
amalgam of features from the Bronze Age to the early Archaic Period. Their value for historians,
as a result, rests more on their impact on subsequent Greek culture, rather than on their providing
information about Bronze Age Greeks. More than any other literary source, the Homeric Epics
influenced the mentality of the Greeks in thinking about war and what it means to be a hero.
Most other literary sources from the Archaic and Classical periods are easier to interpret than
the Homeric Epics, as we often can date these later sources more precisely and thus know the
period whose values or problems they reflect. There is, however, one important limitation to keep
in mind: the overwhelming majority of surviving literature is from Athens, with very few sources
from other city-states. Some of this distribution of evidence has to do with the differing values of
the city-states themselves. For example, while Greeks of the Classical period considered Sparta to
2 Kurt Raaflaub, “A Historian’s Deadache: How to Read ‘Homeric Society’?” in N. Fisher and H. Van wees eds., Archaic
Greece: New Approaches and New Evidence (London: Duckworth: 1998).
Page | 180
be as great a city as Athens, Spartans valued military valor over all else, so they did not cultivate
arts and letters the way Athenians did. As a result, the only literary sources from Sparta are the
works of two poets, Alcman and Tyrtaeus. Tyrtaeus’ military elegies, like the Homeric epics,
glorify heroic death in battle over life without honor and were likely sung by Spartan warriors as
they marched into battle.
Several genres of non-fiction survive as well, allowing historians to study specific events and
problems in the history of the Greek world, and especially Athens. The works of three major
historians survive from Classical Athens. Herodotus, dubbed the Father of History, wrote the
Histories about the Persian Wars in mid-fifth century BCE. Thucydides, an Athenian general in
the Peloponnesian War, wrote a history of the Peloponnesian War over the course of the war (431
– 404 BCE). Finally, Xenophon wrote a history of the end of the Peloponnesian War, starting with
411 BCE, where Thucydides’ work ended, and into the fourth century. In addition to the works of the
historians, philosophical treatises – most notably, those of Plato and Aristotle – provide crucial
insight into the political thought, moral values, and perceptions of the world in late fifth and fourth
centuries BCE. The approximately 100 surviving courtroom speeches from the same period likewise
provide us with a window into the Athenian legal system. Finally, the Hippocratic corpus, a series
of medical treatises and physicians’ journals from the Classical period, help us to understand the
Greeks’ views of the human body and diseases. But in addition to the geographical restrictions of
these sources, which largely document Athens, it is also important to note two other key limitations
of the available evidence. First, virtually all of the literary sources were written by men and provide
very little evidence of the lives and perspectives of women in the Greek world, except as seen through
the eyes of men. Second, most of the authors were wealthy and socially prominent individuals; thus,
their perspective does not reflect that of less affluent citizens and slaves.
Archaeological evidence
thankfully allows historians to fill
some of the gaps in the literary
evidence, but also comes with
problems of its own. One joke
that refers to the optimism of
archaeologists reflects some of
these problems of interpretation:
whenever an archaeologist finds
three stones that are together, he
labels the find as a Minoan palace.
Whenever he finds two stones
that are together, he thinks he has
found a city wall. Whenever he
finds one building stone, he thinks
he has found a house.
Still, archaeological sources
provide us with key information

remains, in different sites across
the Mediterranean also allow
historians to map trading routes
– for instance, Figures 5.1 and
5.2 show vases that were made in
Euboea and Corinth respectively,
but were found in Greek colonies
in Italy. In addition, images on
pottery provide information about stories and myths that have entered popular culture and
that sometimes reflect further aspects of everyday life. For instance, the prevalence of images
of women gathering at public fountains on Athenian hydriae (water pots) from the late sixth
century BCE shows the importance of the public fountains for the social life of women in Athens
in the period.
Finally, written archaeological
sources, such as inscriptions on
stone or pottery shards from all over
the Greek world, and papyri from
Hellenistic Egypt, are the equivalent
of documentary archives from the
ancient world. The evidence from
epigraphy (inscriptions) includes
laws that were written on large
stones and set up in public, such
as the monumental law-code from
Gortyn, Crete, and lists of war-dead,
as well as private tomb inscriptions.
Papyri, on the other hand,
include such private documents as
prenuptial agreements (among the
strangest are prenuptial documents
for brother-sister marriages – legal

in Egypt but nowhere else in the Greek world), divorce documents, loans, and village police reports
(cattle theft appears to have been a serious problem in the Faiyum in the Hellenistic Period!).
Taken together, the literary and archaeological sources allow the historian to complete much
more of the puzzle than would have been possible with just one of these types of sources. Still,
significant gaps in knowledge remain nevertheless, and are, perhaps, one of the joys of studying
ancient history: the historian gets to play the part of a sleuth, attempting to reconstruct the history
of events based on just a few available clues.
5.8 FROM MYTHOLOGY TO HISTORY
The terms “mythology” and “history” may seem, by modern definitions, to be antithetical.
After all, mythology refers to stories that are clearly false, of long-forgotten gods and heroes and
their miraculous feats. History, on the other hand, refers to actual events that involved real people.
And yet, the idea that the two are opposites would have seemed baffling to a typical resident of the
ancient Mediterranean world. Rather, gods and myths were part of the everyday life, and historical
events could become subsumed by myths just as easily as myths could become a part of history.
For instance, Gilgamesh, the hero of the Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, was a real king of Uruk,
yet he also became the hero of the epic. Each Greek city-state, in particular, had a foundation
myth describing its origins as well as its own patron gods and goddesses. Etiological myths,
furthermore, served to explain why certain institutions or practices existed; for instance, the tragic
trilogy Oresteia of the Athenian poet Aeschylus tells the etiological myth for the establishment of
the Athenian murder courts in the Classical period.
Yet, while the Greeks saw mythology and history as related concepts and sometimes as two
sides of the same coin, one specific mythical event marked, in the eyes of the earliest known Greek
historians, the beginning of the story of Greek-speaking peoples. That event was the Trojan War.
5.8.1 Homer and the Trojan War
It is telling that the two earliest Greek historians, Herodotus, writing in the mid-fifth century
BCE, and Thucydides, writing in the last third of the fifth century BCE, began their respective
histories with the Trojan War, each treating it as a historical event. The Homeric epics Iliad
and Odyssey portray the war as an organized attack of a unified Greek army against Troy, a
city in Asia Minor (see map 5.2). The instigating offense? The Trojan prince Paris kidnapped
Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world, from her husband Menelaus, king of Sparta. This
offense, interpreted as a slight to Menelaus’ honor, prompted Agamemnon, king of Mycenae and
Menelaus’ brother, to raise an army from the entire Greek world and sail to Troy. The mythical
tradition had it that after a brutal ten-year siege, the Greeks resorted to a trick: they presented the
Trojans with a hollow wooden horse, filled with armed soldiers. The Trojans tragically accepted
the gift, ostensibly intended as a dedication to the goddess Athena. That same night, the armed
contingent emerged from the horse, and the city finally fell to the Greeks. Picking up the story ten
years after the end of the Trojan War, the Odyssey then told the story of Odysseus’s struggles to 
Page | 183
CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
return home after the war and the changes that reverberated throughout the Greek world after
the fall of Troy.
The Homeric epics were the foundation of Greek education in the Archaic and Classical periods
and, as such, are a historian’s best source of pan-Hellenic values. A major theme throughout
both epics is personal honor, which Homeric heroes value more than the collective cause. For
example, when Agamemnon slights Achilles’ honor in the beginning of the Iliad, Achilles, the
best hero of the Greeks, withdraws from battle for much of the epic, even though his action
causes the Greeks to start losing battles until he rejoins the fight. A related theme is competitive
excellence, with kleos (eternal glory) as its goal: all Greek heroes want to be the best; thus,
even while fighting in the same army, they see each other as competition. Ultimately, Achilles
has to make a choice: he can live a long life and die unknown, or he can die in battle young and
have everlasting glory. Achilles’ selection of the second option made him the inspiration for such
historical Greek warriors and generals as Alexander the Great, who brought his scroll copy of the
Iliad with him on all campaigns. Finally, the presence of the gods in the background of the Trojan
War shows the Greeks’ belief that the gods were everywhere, and acted in the lives of mortals.
These gods could be powerful benefactors and patrons of individuals who respected them and
sought their favor, or vicious enemies, bent on destruction. Indeed, early in the Iliad, the god
Apollo sends a plague on the Greek army at Troy, as punishment for disrespecting his priest.
It is important to note that while the Homeric epics influenced Greek values from the Archaic
period on, they do not reflect the reality of the Greek world in any one period. Furthermore, they
were not composed by a single poet, Homer; indeed, it is possible that Homer never existed.
Because the epics were composed orally by multiple bards over the period of several hundred
years, they combine details about technological and other aspects of the Bronze Age with those
of the Dark Ages and even the early Archaic Age. For instance, the heroes use bronze weapons
side-by-side with iron. Archaeological evidence, however, allows historians to reconstruct to some
extent a picture of the Greek world in the Bronze Age and the Dark Ages.
5.8.2 Greece in the Bronze Age, and the Dark Ages
While there were people living in mainland Greece already in the Neolithic Period, historians
typically begin the study of the Greeks as a unique civilization in the Bronze Age, with the
Minoans. The first literate civilization in Europe, the Minoans were a palace civilization that
flourished on the island of Crete c. 2,000 – 1,450 BCE.
As befits island-dwellers, they were traders and seafarers; indeed, the Greek historian
Thucydides credits them with being the first Greeks to sail on ships. Sir Arthur Evans, the
archaeologist who first excavated Crete in the early 1900s, dubbed them Minoans, after the
mythical Cretan king Minos who was best known for building a labyrinth to house the Minotaur, a
monster that was half-man, half-bull. Bulls appear everywhere in surviving Minoan art, suggesting
that they indeed held a prominent place in Minoan mythology and religion.
Four major palace sites survive on Crete. The most significant of them, Knossos, has been
restored and reconstructed for the benefit of modern tourists. 
Page | 184
Historians hypothesize that the palaces were the homes of local rulers, who ruled and protected
the surrounding farmland. The palaces seem to have kept records in two different writing systems,
the earliest known in Europe: the
Cretan hieroglyphic and Linear A
scripts. Unfortunately, neither of
these systems has been deciphered,
but it is likely that these were palace
inventories and records pertaining
to trade. The palaces had no
surrounding walls, suggesting that
the Cretans maintained peace with
each other and felt safe from outside
attacks, since they lived on an island.
This sense of security proved to be a
mistake as, around 1,450 BCE, the
palaces were violently destroyed by
invaders, possibly the Mycenaeans

who arrived from mainland Greece. Recent
discoveries also suggest that at least some of
the destruction may have been the result of
tsunamis which accompanied the Santorini/
Thera volcanic eruption in the 1600s BCE.
The Mycenaeans, similarly to the Minoans,
were a palace civilization. Flourishing on
mainland Greece c. 1,600 – 1,100 BCE, they
received their name from Mycenae, the most
elaborate surviving palace and the mythical
home of Agamemnon, the commander-inchief of the Greek army in the Trojan War.
The archaeological excavations of graves in
Mycenae reveal a prosperous civilization that
produced elaborate pottery, bronze weapons
and tools, and extravagant jewelry and other
objects made of precious metals and gems. One of the most famous finds is the so-called “Mask
of Agamemnon,” a burial mask with which one aristocrat was buried, made of hammered gold.
The Mycenaeans also kept palace records in a syllabic script, known as Linear B. Related to the
Cretan Linear A script, Linear B, however, has been deciphered, and identified as Greek.
Archaeological evidence also shows that sometime in the 1,200s BCE, the Mycenaean palaces
suffered a series of attacks and were gradually
abandoned over the next century. The period
that begins around 1,000 BCE is known as the
“Dark Ages” because of the notable decline,
in contrast with the preceding period. The
Mycenaean Linear B script disappears, and
archaeological evidence shows a poorer
Greece with a decline in material wealth
and life expectancy. Some contact, however,
must have remained with the rest of the
Mediterranean, as shown by the emergence
of the Greek alphabet, adapted from the
Phoenician writing system towards the end of
the Dark Ages or early in the Archaic Period.
5.9 ARCHAIC GREECE
The story of the Greek world in the Dark
Ages could mostly be described as a story
of fragmentation. With a few exceptions,

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
individual sites had limited contact with each other. The Archaic period, however, appears to have
been a time of growing contacts and connections between different parts of mainland Greece.
Furthermore, it was a time of expansion, as the establishment of overseas colonies and cities
brought the Greeks to Italy and Sicily in the West, and Asia Minor and the Black Sea littoral in the
East. Furthermore, while Greeks in the Archaic period saw themselves as citizens of individual
city-states, this period also witnessed the rise of a Pan-Hellenic identity, as all Greeks saw
themselves connected by virtue of their common language, religion, and Homeric values. This
Pan-Hellenic identity was ultimately cemented during the Persian Wars: two invasions of Greece
by the Persian Empire at the end of the Archaic period.
5.9.1 Rise of the Hoplite Phalanx and the Polis
 A Corinthian vase, known today as the Chigi Vase, made in the mid-seventh century BCE,
presents a tantalizing glimpse of the changing times from the Dark Ages to the Archaic Period.
Taking up much of the decorated space on the vase is a battle scene. Two armies of warriors with
round shields, helmets, and spears are facing each other and appear to be marching in formation
towards each other in preparation for attack.
Modern scholars largely consider the vase to be the earliest artistic portrayal of the hoplite
phalanx, a new way of fighting that spread around the Greek world in the early Archaic Age and
that coincided with the rise of another key institution for subsequent Greek history: the polis,
or city-state. From the early Archaic period to the conquest of the Greek world by Philip and
Alexander in the late fourth century BCE, the polis was the central unit of organization in the
Greek world.
While warfare in the Iliad
consisted largely of duels between
individual heroes, the hoplite
phalanx was a new mode of fighting
that did not rely on the skill of
individuals. Rather, it required all
soldiers in the line to work together
as a whole. Armed in the same way
– with a helmet, spear, and the
round shield, the hoplon, which
gave the hoplites their name – the
soldiers were arranged in rows,
possibly as much as seven deep.
Each soldier carried his shield on
his left arm, protecting the left side
of his own body and the right side
of his comrade to the left. Working
together as one, then, the phalanx

would execute the othismos (a mass shove) during battle, with the goal of shoving the enemy
phalanx off the battlefield.
Historians do not know which came into existence first, the phalanx or the polis, but the two
clearly reflect a similar ideology. In fact, the phalanx could be seen as a microcosm of the polis,
exemplifying the chief values of the polis on a small scale. Each polis was a fully self-sufficient
unit of organization, with its own laws, definition of citizenship, government, army, economy,
and local cults. Regardless of the differences between the many poleis in matters of citizenship,
government, and law, one key similarity is clear: the survival of the polis depended on the
dedication of all its citizens to the collective well-being of the city-state. This dedication included
service in the phalanx. As a result, citizenship in most Greek city-states was closely connected to
military service, and women were excluded from citizenship. Furthermore, since hoplites had
to provide their own armor, these citizen-militias effectively consisted of landowners. This is
not to say, though, that the poorer citizens were entirely excluded from serving their city. One
example of a way in which they may have participated even in the phalanx appears on the Chigi
Vase. Marching between two lines of warriors is an unarmed man, playing a double-reed flute
(seen on the right end of the top band in Figure 5.10). Since the success of the phalanx depended
on marching together in step, the flute-player’s music would have been essential to ensure that
everyone kept the same tempo during the march.
5.9.2 Greek Religion
One theory modern scholars have proposed for the rise of the polis connects the locations of
the city-states to known cult-sites. The theory argues that the Greeks of the Archaic period built
city-states around these precincts of various gods in order to live closer to them and protect them.
While impossible to know for sure if this theory or any other regarding the rise of the polis is true,
the building of temples in cities during the Archaic period shows the increasing emphasis that the
poleis were placing on religion.
It is important to note that Greek religion seems to have been, at least to some extent, an
element of continuity from the Bronze Age to the Archaic period and beyond. The important
role that the gods play in the Homeric epics attests to their prominence in the oral tradition,
going back to the Dark Ages. Furthermore, names of the following major gods worshipped in the
Archaic period and beyond were found on the deciphered Linear B tablets: Zeus, king of the gods
and god of weather, associated with the thunderbolt; Hera, Zeus’ wife and patroness of childbirth;
Poseidon, god of the sea; Hermes, messenger god and patron of thieves and merchants; Athena,
goddess of war and wisdom and patroness of women’s crafts; Ares, god of war; Dionysus, god of
wine; and the twins Apollo, god of the sun and both god of the plague and a healer, and Artemis,
goddess of the hunt and the moon. All of these gods continued to be the major divinities in Greek
religion for its duration, and many of them were worshipped as patron gods of individual cities,
such as Artemis at Sparta, and Athena at Athens.
While many local cults of even major gods were truly local in appeal, a few local cults achieved
truly Pan-Hellenic appeal. Drawing visitors from all over the Greek world, these Pan-Hellenic 
Page | 189
CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
cults were seen as belonging equally to all the
Greeks. One of the most famous examples is the
cult of Asclepius at Epidaurus. Asclepius, son
of Apollo, was a healer god, and his shrine at
Epidaurus attracted the pilgrims from all over
the Greek world. Visitors suffering from illness
practiced incubation, that is, spending the night
in the temple, in the hopes of receiving a vision
in their dreams suggesting a cure. In gratitude for
the god’s healing, some pilgrims dedicated casts
of their healed body parts. Archaeological findings
include a plentitude of ears, noses, arms, and feet.
Starting out as local cults, several religious
festivals that included athletic competitions as
part of the celebration also achieved Pan-Hellenic
prominence during the Archaic period. The most
influential of these were the Olympic Games.
Beginning in 776 BCE, the Olympic Games were
held in Olympia every four years in honor of Zeus;
they drew competitors from all over the Greek
world, and even Persia. The Pan-Hellenic appeal
of the Olympics is signified by the impact that
these games had on Greek politics: for instance, a truce was in effect throughout the Greek world for
the duration of each Olympics. In addition, the Olympics provided a Pan-Hellenic system of dating
events by Olympiads or four-year cycles.
Finally, perhaps the most politically influential of the Pan-Hellenic cults was the oracle of
Apollo at Delphi, established sometime in the eighth century BCE. Available for consultation
only nine days a year, the oracle spoke responses to the questions asked by inquirers through
a priestess, named the Pythia. The Pythia’s responses came in the form of poetry and were
notoriously difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, city-states and major rulers throughout the Greek
world considered it essential to consult the oracle before embarking on any major endeavor, such
as war or founding a colony.
5.9.3 Maritime Trade and Colonization
The historian Herodotus records that sometime c. 630 BCE, the king of the small island of Thera
traveled to Delphi to offer a sacrifice and consult the oracle on a few minor points. To his surprise,
the oracle’s response had nothing to do with his queries. Instead, the Pythia directed him to found a
colony in Libya, in North Africa. Having never heard of Libya, the king ignored the advice. A sevenyear drought ensued, and the Therans felt compelled to consult the oracle again. Receiving the same
response as before, they finally sent out a group of colonists who eventually founded the city of Cyrene.

While this story may sound absurd, it is similar to other
foundation stories of Greek colonies and emphasizes the importance
of the Delphic oracle. At the same time, though, this story still
leaves open the question of motive: why did so many Greek citystates of the Archaic period send out colonies to other parts of the
Greek world? Archaeology and foundation legends, such as those
recorded by Herodotus, suggest two chief reasons: population
pressures along with shortage of productive farmland in the cities
on mainland Greece, and increased ease of trade that colonies
abroad facilitated. In addition to resolving these two problems,
however, the colonies also had the unforeseen impact of increasing
interactions of the Greeks with the larger Mediterranean world and
the ancient Near East. These interactions are visible, for instance,
in the so-called Orientalizing style of art in the Archaic period, a
style the Greeks borrowed from the Middle East and Egypt.
As section 5.3.5 will show, however, the presence of Greek
colonies in Asia Minor also played a major role in bringing about
the Greco-Persian Wars.
5.9.4. Aristocracy, Democracy, and Tyranny in
Archaic Greece
Later Greek historians, including Herodotus and Thucydides,
noted a certain trend in the trajectory of the history of most Greek
poleis: most city-states started out with a monarchical or quasimonarchical government. Over time the people gained greater
representation, and an assembly of all citizens had at least some
degree of political power—although some degree of strife typically
materialized between the aristocrats and the poorer elements. Taking advantage of such civic
conflicts, tyrants came to power in most city-states for a brief period before the people banded
together and drove them out, thenceforth replacing them with a more popular form of government.
Many modern historians are skeptical about some of the stories that the Greek historians tell
about origins of some poleis; for instance, it is questionable whether the earliest Thebans truly were
born from dragon teeth. Similarly, the stories about some of the Archaic tyrants seem to belong
more to the realm of legend than history. Nevertheless, the preservation of stories about tyrants in
early oral tradition suggests that city-states likely went through periods of turmoil and change in
their form of government before developing a more stable constitution. Furthermore, this line of
development accurately describes the early history of Athens, the best-documented polis.
In the early Archaic period, Athens largely had an aristocratic constitution. Widespread debtslavery, however, caused significant civic strife in the city and led to the appointment of Solon as
lawgiver for the year 594/3 BCE, specifically for the purpose of reforming the laws. Solon created a

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
more democratic constitution and also left poetry documenting justifications for his reforms—and
different citizens’ reactions to them. Most controversial of all, Solon instituted a one-time debtforgiveness, seisachtheia, which literally means “shaking off.” He proceeded to divide all citizens
into five classes based on income, assigning a level of political participation and responsibility
commensurate with each class. Shortly after Solon’s reforms, a tyrant, Peisistratus, illegally
seized control of Athens and remained in power off and on from 561 to 527 BCE. Peisistratus
seems to have been a reasonably popular ruler who had the support of a significant portion of the
Athenian population. His two sons, Hippias and Hipparchus, however, appear to have been less
well-liked. Two men, Harmodius and Aristogeiton, assassinated Hipparchus in 514 BCE; then
in 508 BCE, the Athenians, with the help of a Spartan army, permanently drove out Hippias.
In subsequent Athenian history, Harmodius and Aristogeiton were considered heroes of the
democracy and celebrated as tyrannicides.

Immediately following the expulsion of Hippias, Athens underwent a second round of
democratic reforms, led by Cleisthenes. The Cleisthenic constitution remained in effect, with
few changes, until the Macedonian conquest of Athens in the fourth century BCE and is considered
to be the Classical Athenian democracy. Central to the democracy was the participation of all
citizens in two types of institutions: the ekklesia, an assembly of all citizens, which functioned as
the chief deliberative body of the city; and the law-courts, to which citizens were assigned by lot
as jurors. Two chief offices, the generals and the archos, ruled over the city and were appointed
for one-year terms. Ten generals were elected annually by the ekklesia for the purpose of leading
the Athenian military forces. Finally, the leading political office each year, the nine archons, were
appointed by lot from all eligible citizens. While this notion of appointing the top political leaders
by lot may seem surprising, it exemplifies the Athenians’ pride in their democracy and their desire
to believe that, in theory at least, all Athenian citizens were equally valuable and capable of leading
their city-state.
Developing in a very different manner from Athens, Sparta was seen by other Greek poleis
as a very different sort of city from the rest. Ruled from an early period by two kings – one from
each of the two royal houses that ruled jointly – Sparta was a true oligarchy, in which the power

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
rested in its gerousia, a council
of thirty elders, whose number
included the two kings. While an
assembly of all citizens existed
as well, its powers were much
more limited than were those
of the Athenian assembly. Yet
because of much more restrictive
citizenship rules, Spartan
assembly of citizens would have
felt as a more selective body, as
Figure 5.14 illustrates.
A crucial moment in Spartan
history was the city’s conquest of
the nearby region of Messenia in
the eighth century BCE.
The Spartans annexed the
Messenian territory to their
own and made the Messenians
helots. While the helots could
not be bought or sold, they were
permanently tied to the land
in a status akin to medieval
European serfs. The availability of helot labor allowed the Spartans from that point on to focus
their attention on military training. This focus transformed Sparta into the ultimate military state
in the Greek world, widely respected by the other Greek poleis for its military prowess. Other
Greeks were fascinated by such Spartan practices as the communal bringing up of all children
apart from their parents and the requirement that all Spartan girls and women, as well as boys
and men, maintain a strict regimen of exercise and training.
But while Athens and Sparta sound like each other’s diametrical opposites, the practices
of both poleis ultimately derived from the same belief that all city-states held: that, in order to
ensure their city’s survival, the citizens must place their city-state’s interests above their own. A
democracy simply approached this goal with a different view of the qualifications of its citizens
than did an oligarchy.
A final note on gender is necessary, in connection with Greek city-states’ definitions of
citizenship. Only children of legally married and freeborn citizen parents could be citizens in most
city-states. Women had an ambiguous status in the Greek poleis. While not full-fledged citizens
themselves, they produced citizens. This view of the primary importance of wives in the city as
the mothers of citizens resulted in diametrically opposite laws in Athens and Sparta, showing
the different values that the respective cities emphasized. In Athens, if a husband caught his wife
with an adulterer in his home, the law allowed the husband to kill said adulterer on the spot. The

adultery law was so harsh precisely because adultery put into question the citizenship status of
potential children, thereby depriving the city of future citizens. By contrast, Spartan law allowed
an unmarried man who wanted offspring to sleep with the wife of another man, with the latter’s
consent, specifically for the purpose of producing children. This law reflects the importance that
Sparta placed on producing strong future soldiers as well as the communal attitude of the city
towards family and citizenship.
5.9.5 The Persian Wars
Despite casting their net far and wide in founding colonies, the Greeks seem to have remained
in a state of relatively peaceful coexistence with the rest of their Mediterranean neighbors until the
sixth century BCE. In the mid-sixth century BCE, Cyrus, an ambitious king of Persia, embarked
on a swift program of expansion, ultimately consolidating under his rule the largest empire of the
ancient world and earning for himself the title “Cyrus the Great.”
Cyrus’ Achaemenid Empire bordered the area of Asia Minor that had been previously
colonized by the Greeks. This expansion of the Persian Empire brought the Persians into direct
conflict with the Greeks and became the origin of the Greco-Persian Wars, the greatest military
conflict the Greek world had known up until that point.
Over the second half of the sixth century, the Persians had taken over the region of Asia Minor,
also known as Ionia, installing as rulers of these Greek city-states tyrants loyal to Persia. In 499
BCE, however, the Greek city-states in Asia Minor joined forces to rebel against the Persian rule.
Athens and Eretria sent military support for this Ionian Revolt, and the rebelling forces marched
on the Persian capital of Sardis and burned it in 498 BCE, before the revolt was finally subdued
by the Persians in 493 BCE.
Seeking revenge on Athens and Eretria, the Persian king Darius launched an expedition in
490 BCE.
Darius’ forces captured Eretria in
mid-summer, destroyed the city, and
enslaved its inhabitants. Sailing a short
distance across the bay, the Persian
army then landed at Marathon. The
worried Athenians sent a plea for help
to Sparta. The Spartans, in the middle
of a religious festival, refused to help.
So, on September 12, 490 BCE, the
Athenians, with only a small force of
Plataeans helping, faced the much
larger Persian army in the Battle of
Marathon. The decisive Athenian
victory showed the superiority of the

end of the first Persian invasion of Greece. Furthermore, the victory at Marathon, which remained
a point of pride for the Athenians for centuries after, demonstrated to the rest of the Greeks that
Sparta was not the only great military power in Greece.
Darius died in 486 BCE, having never realized his dream of revenge against the Greeks. His
son, Xerxes, however, continued his father’s plans and launched in 480 BCE a second invasion
of Greece, with an army so large that, as the historian Herodotus claims, it drank entire rivers dry
on its march. The Greek world reacted in a much more organized fashion to this second invasion
than it did to the first. Led by Athens and Sparta, some seventy Greek poleis formed a sworn
alliance to fight together against the Persians. This alliance, the first of its kind, proved to be the
key to defeating the Persians as it allowed the allies to split forces strategically in order to guard
against Persian attack by both land and sea. The few Greek city-states who declared loyalty to the

Persian Empire instead–most notably, Thebes–were seen as traitors for centuries to come by the
rest of the Greeks.
Marching through mainland Greece from the north, the Persians first confronted the Spartans
at the Battle of Thermopylae, a narrow mountain pass that stood in the way of the Persians’
accessing any point south. In this now-legendary battle, 300 Spartans, led by their king Leonidas,
successfully defended the pass for two days before being betrayed by a local who showed a
roundabout route to the Persians. The Persians then were able to outflank the Spartans and kill
them to the last man. This battle, although a loss for the Greeks, bought crucial time for the rest
of the Greek forces in preparing to face the Persians. It is also important to note that although the
Spartans were considered even in the ancient world to be the heroes of Thermopylae, they were
also accompanied by small contingents from several other Greek city-states in this endeavor.
The victory at Thermopylae fulfilled the old dream of Darius, as it allowed access to Athens
for the Persians. The Athenian statesman Themistocles, however, had ordered a full evacuation
of the city in advance of the Persian attack through an unusual interpretation of a Delphic oracle
stating that wooden walls will save Athens. Taking the oracle to mean that the wooden walls in
question were ships, Themistocles built a massive fleet which he used to send all of the city’s
inhabitants to safety. His gamble proved to be successful, and the Persians captured and burned
a mostly empty city.
The Athenians proceeded to defeat the Persian fleet at the Battle of Salamis, off the coast of
Athens, thus shortly before winter turning the tide of the war in favor of the Greeks. Finally, in June
of 479 BCE, the Greek forces were able to strike the two final blows, defeating the Persian land and
sea forces on the same day in the Battle of Plataea on land and the Battle of Mycale on sea. The
victory at Mycale also resulted in a second Ionian revolt, which this time ended in a victory for the
Greek city-states in Asia Minor. Xerxes was left to sail home to his diminished empire.
It is difficult to overestimate the impact of the Persian Wars on subsequent Greek history. Seen
by historians as the end-point of the Archaic Period, the Persian Wars cemented Pan-Hellenic
identity, as they saw cooperation on an unprecedented scale among the Greek city-states. In
addition, the Persian Wars showed the Greek military superiority over the Persians on both land
and sea. Finally, the wars showed Athens in a new light to the rest of the Greeks. As the winners of
Marathon in the first invasion and the leaders of the navy during the second invasion, the Athenians
emerged from the wars as the rivals of Sparta for military prestige among the Greeks. This last
point, in particular, proved to be the most influential for Greek history in the subsequent period.
5.10 THE CLASSICAL PERIOD
So far, the story of the Greek world in this chapter has proceeded from a narrative of the
fragmented Greek world in the Dark Ages to the emergence and solidification of a Pan-Hellenic
identity in the Archaic Period. The story of the Greeks in the Classical Period, by contrast, is
best described as the strife for leadership of the Greek world. First, Athens and Sparta spent
much of the fifth century BCE battling each other for control of the Greek world. Then, once both
were weakened, other states began attempting to fill the power vacuum. Ultimately, the Classical

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
Period will end with the Greek world under the control of a power that was virtually unknown to
the Greeks at the beginning of the fifth century BCE: Macedon.
5.10.1 From the Delian League to the Athenian Empire
In 478 BCE, barely a year after the end of the Persian Wars, a group of Greek city-states,
mainly those located in Ionia and on the island between mainland Greece and Ionia, founded the
Delian League, with the aim of continuing to protect the Greeks in Ionia from Persian attacks.
Led by Athens, the league first met on the tiny island of Delos. According to Greek mythology, the
twin gods Apollo and Artemis were born on Delos. As a result, the island was considered sacred
ground and, as such, was a fitting neutral headquarters for the new alliance. The league allowed
member states the option of either contributing a tax (an option that most members selected)

Page | 198
or contributing ships for the league’s navy. The treasury of the league, where the taxes paid by
members were deposited, was housed on Delos.
Over the next twenty years, the Delian League gradually transformed from a loose alliance of
states led by Athens to a more formal entity. The League’s Athenian leadership, in the meanwhile,
grew to be that of an imperial leader. The few members who tried to secede from the League, such
as the island of Naxos, quickly learned that doing so was not an option as the revolt was violently
subdued. Finally, in 454 BCE, the treasury of the Delian League moved to Athens. That moment
marked the transformation of the Delian League into the Athenian Empire.
Since the Athenians publicly inscribed each year the one-sixtieth portion of the tribute that
they dedicated to Athena, records survive listing the contributing members for a number of years,
thereby allowing historians to see the magnitude of the Athenian operation.
While only the Athenian side of the story survives, it appears that the Athenians’ allies in the
Delian League were not happy with the transformation of the alliance into a full-fledged Athenian
Empire. Non-allies were affected a well. The fifth-century BCE Athenian historian Thucydides
dramatizes in his history one particularly harsh treatment of a small island, Melos, which effectively
refused to join the Athenian cause. To add insult to injury, once the treasury of the Empire had been
moved to Athens, the Athenians had used some funds from it for their own building projects, the
most famous of these projects being the Parthenon, the great temple to Athena on the Acropolis.
The bold decision to move the treasury of the Delian League to Athens was the brainchild
of the leading Athenian statesman of the fifth century BCE, Pericles. A member of a prominent
aristocratic family, Pericles was a predominant politician for forty years, from the early 460s BCE
to his death in 429 BCE, and was instrumental in the development of a more popular democracy
in Athens. Under his leadership, an especially vibrant feeling of Athenian patriotic pride seems
to have developed, and the decision to move the Delian League treasury to Athens fits into this
pattern as well. Shortly after moving
the treasury to Athens, Pericles
sponsored a Citizenship Decree in
451 BCE that restricted Athenian
citizenship from thence onwards
only to individuals who had two freeborn and legitimately-wed Athenian
parents, both of whom were also born
of Athenian parents. Then c. 449 BCE,
Pericles successfully proposed a decree
allowing the Athenians to use Delian
League funds for Athenian building
projects, and, c. 447 BCE, he sponsored
the Athenian Coinage Decree, a decree
that imposed Athenian standards of
weights and measures on all states that
were members of the Delian League.

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
Later in his life, Pericles famously described Athens as “the school of Hellas;” this description
would certainly have fit Athens just as much in the mid-fifth century BCE as, in addition to the
flourishing of art and architecture, the city was a center of philosophy and drama.
The growing wealth and power of Athens in the twenty or so years since the Persian Wars
did not escape Sparta and led to increasingly tense relations between the two leading powers in
Greece. Sparta had steadily consolidated the Peloponnesian League in this same time-period, but
Sparta’s authority over this league was not quite as strict as was the Athenian control over the
Delian League. Finally, in the period of 460-445 BCE, the Spartans and the Athenians engaged
in a series of battles, to which modern scholars refer as the First Peloponnesian War. In 445
BCE, the two sides swore to a Thirty Years Peace, a treaty that allowed both sides to return to their
pre-war holdings, with few exceptions. Still, Spartan unease in this period of Athenian expansion
and prosperity, which resulted in the First Peloponnesian War, was merely a sign of much more
serious conflict to come. As the Athenian general and historian Thucydides later wrote about the
reasons for the Great Peloponnesian War, which erupted in 431 BCE: “But the real cause of the
war was one that was formally kept out of sight. The growing power of Athens, and the fear that it
inspired in Sparta, made the war inevitable” (Thucydides, I.23).
5.10.2 The Peloponnesian War (431 – 404 BCE)
Historians today frown on the use of the term “inevitable” to describe historical events. Still,
Thucydides’ point about the inevitability of the Peloponnesian War is perhaps appropriate,
as following a conflict that had been bubbling under the surface for fifty years, the war finally
broke out over a seemingly minor affair. In 433 BCE, Corcyra, a colony of Corinth that no longer
wanted to be under the control of its mother-city, asked Athens for protection against Corinth.
The Corinthians claimed that the Athenian support of Corcyra was a violation of the Thirty Years
Peace. At a subsequent meeting of the Peloponnesian League in Sparta in 432 BCE, the allies,
along with Sparta, voted that the peace had been broken and so declared war against Athens.
At the time of the war’s declaration, no one thought that it would last twenty-seven years and
would ultimately embroil the entire Greek-speaking world. Rather, the Spartans expected that
they would march with an army to Athens, fight a decisive battle, then return home forthwith.
The long duration of the war, however, was partly the result of the different strengths of the two
leading powers. Athens was a naval empire, with allies scattered all over the Ionian Sea. Sparta,
on the other hand, was a land-locked power with supporters chiefly in the Peloponnese and with
no navy to speak of at the outset of the war.
The Peloponnesian War brought about significant changes in the government of both Athens
and Sparta, so that, by the end of the war, neither power looked as it did at its outset. Athens, in
particular, became more democratic because of increased need for manpower to row its fleet.
The lowest census bracket, the thetes, whose poverty and inability to buy their own armor had
previously excluded them from military service, became by the end of the war a full-fledged
part of the Athenian forces and required a correspondingly greater degree of political influence.
In the case of Sparta, the war had ended the Spartan policy of relative isolationism from the 
Page | 200
rest of the affairs of the Greek city-states. The
length of the war also brought about significant
changes to the nature of Greek warfare. While
war was previously largely a seasonal affair,
with many conflicts being decided with a single
battle, the Peloponnesian War forced the Greek
city-states to support standing armies. Finally,
while sieges of cities and attacks on civilians
were previously frowned upon, they became the
norm by the end of the Peloponnesian War. In
short, Thucydides’s narrative of the war shows
that the war had a detrimental effect on human
nature, encouraging a previously unprecedented
degree of cruelty on both sides. It is important
to note, though, that as brutal as sieges could
be during the Peloponnesian War, Greek siege
warfare during the fifth century BCE was still
quite primitive, as no tools existed for ramming
or otherwise damaging the city gates or walls.
Furthermore, catapults, so useful for targeting
a city from the outside, first came into being in
399 BCE, five years after the war had ended.
Modern historians divide the Peloponnesian
War into three distinct stages, based on the
tactics used in each: the Archidamian War,
the Peace of Nicias, and the Decelean War.
The first stage, the Archidamian War (431 –
421 BCE), is named after the Spartan king
Archidamus, who proposed the strategy of annual invasions of Attica at the beginning of the
war. Beginning in late spring and early summer of 431 BCE, Archidamus led the Spartan army
to invade Attica in order to devastate the agricultural land around the city. The Spartans thereby
hoped to provoke the Athenians to a battle. Pericles however, refused to enter into battle against
the Spartans, and instead ordered all inhabitants of Attica to retreat within the city. Pericles’
decision was wise, as the Athenians would likely have lost a land battle against the Spartans.
His decision, though, had unforeseen repercussions. In 430 BCE, the crowded conditions within
Athens resulted in the outbreak of a virulent plague which by some estimates killed as much as
twenty-five percent of the city’s population over the following three years. Among the dead was
none other than Pericles himself.
The plague had significant repercussions for Athens during the first phase of the war because
of not only the loss of fighting men to disease and the consequent lowered morale in the city, but
also the death of Pericles, the moderate leader. The subsequent leaders who emerged, such as

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
Cleon, were known as war-hawks. Meanwhile, the Spartans continued their annual invasions of
Attica until 425 BCE, when luck was finally on the Athenians’ side.
In 425 BCE, the Athenian fleet faced a new Spartan fleet in the Battle of Pylos in the
Peloponnese. The Athenians won the battle and also managed to trap 420 Spartans on the tiny
island of Sphacteria, just off the coast of Pylos. Sending shockwaves through the entire Greek
world, the Spartans surrendered. By bringing the hostages to Athens, the Athenians put an end to
the annual invasions of Attica. Finally, in 421 BCE, with the death of the most pro-war generals
on both sides, the Athenians with their allies signed a peace treaty with Spartans and their allies.
Named the “Peace of Nicias” after the Athenian general who brokered this treaty, it was supposed
to be a fifty years’ peace; it allowed both sides to return to their pre-war holdings, with a few
exceptions. As part of the peace terms, the Spartan hostages from Pylos were finally released.
Despite its ambitious casting as a fifty years’ peace, the Peace of Nicias proved to be a short and
uneasy time filled with minor battles and skirmishes. One problem with the treaty was that while
Athens and all of its allies signed the peace, several key allies of Sparta, including Corinth and Thebes,
refused to do so. Furthermore, Athens made the disastrous decision during this stalemate to launch
the Sicilian Expedition, a venture that took much of the Athenian fleet to Sicily in 415 BCE.
Syracuse, however, proved to be a difficult target, and the expedition ended in 413 BCE with a
complete destruction of the Athenian navy. That same year, the Spartans renewed the fighting,
launching the third and final phase of the Peloponnesian War.
In the third stage of the Peloponnesian war, also known as the Decelean War, the Spartans
took the war to Attic soil by occupying Decelea, a village in Attica proper, and transforming it into a
Map 5.10 | Map of the Sicilian Expedition

military fort. This occupation allowed the Spartans to prevent the Athenians from farming their
land and cutting off Athens from most supply routes, effectively crippling the Athenian economy
for the remainder of the war. Losing the Sicilian Expedition and the challenge of the Decelean
War produced a high level of resentment towards the democratic leaders in Athens. Therefore in
411 BCE, an oligarchic coup briefly replaced the democracy with the rule of the Four Hundred.
While this oligarchy was quickly overthrown and the democracy restored, this internal instability
highlighted the presence of the aristocratic element in the city as well as the dissatisfaction of at
least the aristocratic citizens with the long war.
Remarkably, in a testament to the resilience and power of the Athenian state, the Athenians
managed to rebuild a navy after the Sicilian Expedition, and even managed to continue to win
battles on sea during this final phase of the war. In 405 BCE, however, the Spartan general Lysander
defeated Athens in the naval battle of Aegospotami. He proceeded to besiege Athens, and the city
finally surrendered in 404 BCE. For the second time in a decade, the Athenian democracy was
overthrown, to be replaced this time by the Spartan-sanctioned oligarchy known as the Tyranny
of the Thirty. The rule of the Thirty proved to be a much more brutal oligarchy than that of the
Four Hundred. A year later, an army formed largely of Athenian democrats in exile marched on
the city and overthrew the Thirty. The democracy thus was restored in 403 BCE, and the painful
process of recovery from the war and the oligarchic rule could begin.
5.10.3 Athenian Culture during the Peloponnesian War
Because it drained Athens of manpower and financial resources, the Peloponnesian War
proved to be an utter practical disaster for Athens. Nevertheless, the war period was also the
pinnacle of Athenian culture, most notably its tragedy, comedy, and philosophy. Tragedy and
comedy in Athens were very much popular entertainment, intended to appeal to all citizens. Thus
issues considered in these plays were often ones of paramount concern for the city at the time
when the plays were written. As one character in a comedy bitterly joked in an address to the
audience, more Athenians attended tragic and comic performances than came to vote at assembly
meetings. Not surprisingly, war was a common topic of discussion in the plays. Furthermore, war
was not portrayed positively, as the playwrights repeatedly emphasized the costs of war for both
winners and losers.
Sophocles, one of the two most prominent Athenian tragedians during the Peloponnesian
War era, had served his city as a general, albeit at an earlier period; thus, he had direct experience
with war. Many of his tragedies that were performed during the war dealt with the darker side
of fighting, for both soldiers and generals, and the cities that are affected. By tradition, however,
tragedies tackled contemporary issues through integrating them into mythical stories, and the
two mythical wars that Sophocles portrayed in his tragedies were the Trojan War, as in Ajax and
Philoctetes, and the aftermath of the war of the Seven against Thebes, in which Polynices, the son
of Oedipus, led six other heroes to attack Thebes, a city led by his brother Eteocles, as in Oedipus
at Colonus. Sophocles’ plays repeatedly showed the emotional and psychological challenges of war
for soldiers and civilians alike; they also emphasized the futility of war, as the heroes of his plays, 
Page | 203
CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
just as in the original myths on which they were based, died tragic, untimely deaths. Sophocles’
younger contemporary, Euripides, had a similar interest in depicting the horrors of war and
wrote a number of tragedies on the impact of war on the defeated, such as in Phoenician Women
and Hecuba; both of these plays explored the aftermath of the Trojan War from the perspective
of the defeated Trojans.
While the tragic playwrights explored the impact of the war on both the fighters and the civilians
through narrating mythical events, the comic playwright Aristophanes was far less subtle. The
anti-war civilian who saves the day and ends the war was a common hero in the Aristophanic
comedies. For instance, in the Acharnians (425 BCE), the main character is a war-weary farmer
who, frustrated with the inefficiency of the Athenian leadership in ending the war, brokers his
own personal peace with Sparta. Similarly, in Peace (421 BCE), another anti-war farmer fattens
up a dung beetle in order to fly to Olympus and beg Zeus to free Peace. Finally, in Lysistrata (411
BCE), the wives of all Greek city-states, missing their husbands who are at war, band together in
a plot to end the war by going on a sex-strike until their husbands make peace. By the end of the
play, their wish comes true. Undeniably funny, the jokes in these comedies, nevertheless, have a
bitter edge, akin to the portrayal of war in the tragedies. The overall impression from the war-era
drama is that the playwrights, as well as perhaps the Athenians themselves, spent much of the
Peloponnesian War dreaming of peace.
While the playwrights were dreaming of the things of this world–most notably war–their
contemporary, Socrates, was dreaming of difficult questions. One of the most prominent
philosophers of the ancient world, Socrates has not left any writings of his own, but thoughts
attributed to him survive in dialogues penned by his student, the fourth-century philosopher
Plato. In Plato’s writings, Socrates comes across as someone who loved difficult questions and
who was not above confronting any passers-by with such questions as “What is courage?”; “What
is moral?”; “What would the ideal city look like?” Using what became known ever since as the
“Socratic method,” Socrates continued to probe further every definition and answer that his
conversation partners provided, guiding them to delve deeper in their reflections on the topics at
hand than they had before. As a result of his love of such debates, Socrates was seen as connected
to the Sophists, philosophical debate teachers, who (as Aristophanes joked) could teach anyone
to convince others of anything at all, regardless of reality or truth. But Socrates radically differed
from the Sophists by not charging fees for his teaching. Instead, as he himself is purported to
have said, he was a pest-like gadfly that kept disturbing Athens from growing too content and
encouraged all with whom he spoke to keep thinking and questioning.
5.10.4 The Fourth Century BCE
In 399 BCE, a seventy-year old Athenian was put on trial for impiety and for corrupting the
youth, convicted, and speedily sentenced to death. The trial is especially shocking, since the man
in question was none other than Socrates, the philosopher who had spent his life wandering the
streets of Athens engaging in endless dialogues regarding the meaning of life. Why did the Athenians
suddenly turn against this public teacher and judge him worthy of execution? The answer, most 
Page | 204
likely, is not the openly-stated causes of the trial, but rather the connections that Socrates previously
had to oligarchic leaders. In particular, Socrates had taught Critias, who became one of the Thirty
in 404 BCE. Fueled by their hatred of all enemies of the democracy and anyone who had associated
with the Thirty, the Athenians condemned Socrates to death. This trial shows how deeply the scars
went in the collective psyche and how difficult it was for the Athenians to forget the terrible end of
the Peloponnesian War. And while, as usual, more information survives about how the Athenians—
more than any other polis—dealt with the aftermath of the war, it is clear that for the rest of the

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
Greek world, their life in the fourth
century BCE was very much the
result of the Peloponnesian War.
The early fourth century saw a
power vacuum emerge in the Greek
world for the first time since the
early Archaic Period. Defeated in
the war, Athens was no longer an
Empire, while the winner, Sparta,
had suffered a catastrophic decline
in its population over the course
of the Peloponnesian War. At the
same time, Thebes had revamped
its military, introducing the first two
significant changes to the hoplite phalanx way of fighting since its inception: slightly longer spears,
and wedge formation. The final key to the Theban military supremacy was the Theban Sacred
Band, formed in 378 BCE. An elite core of 300 warriors, the band consisted of 150 couples, based on
the assumption that the lovers would fight most bravely in order not to appear to be cowardly to their
beloved. In 371 BCE, the Thebans demonstrated the success of their military reforms by defeating
the Spartans at the Battle
of Leuctra. They continued
an aggressive program of
military expansion over the
next decade, a period known
as the Theban Hegemony.
Sometime in the 360’s
BCE, a young Macedonian
prince stayed for several
years in Thebes as a hostage.
While there, he caught the
eye of the military reformer,
Epaminondas, who took
the prince under his wing.
Circa 364 BCE, the prince
returned to Macedon, and,
in 359 BCE, he ascended to
the throne as king Philip II.
Up until that point in Greek
history, the Macedonians
had largely been known for
two things: drinking their

wine undiluted, which had marked them as complete and utter barbarians in the eyes of the rest
of the Greeks, and being excellent horsemen. With Philip at the helm, this estimation was about
to change. As soon as he came to the throne, Philip began transforming the Macedonian military
into a more successful image of what he had seen at Thebes. Philip further lengthened the already
longer spears used by the Thebans, creating the Macedonian sarissa, a spear of about eighteen
feet in length, double that of the traditional Greek hoplite spear.
He retained the Theban wedge formation but also added heavy cavalry to the line, thus
incorporating the Macedonians’ strongest element into the phalanx. The results spoke for
themselves, as over the next twenty years, Philip systematically conquered all of mainland Greece,
with the exception of Sparta, which he chose to leave alone. Philip’s final great victory, which he
shared with his teenage son Alexander, was at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BCE), in which the
Macedonian armies defeated the combined forces of Athens and Thebes. Philip’s conquest of the
entire mainland was the end of an era, as for the first time, the entire territory was united under the
rule of a king.
By all accounts, it appears that Philip was not going to stop at just conquering the Greek world.
He did not, however, have this choice. In 336 BCE while on his way to a theatrical performance,
Philip was assassinated by one of his own bodyguards. His son Alexander, then twenty years old,

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
succeeded and continued his father’s ambitious program of conquests. Alexander’s first target
was the Persian Empire, motivated in part by his love of Homer’s Iliad, and the perception among
the Greeks that this new campaign was the continuation of the original, mythical war against Asia.
Moving farther and farther East in his campaigns, Alexander conquered the Balkans, Egypt, and
the territories of modern-day Lebanon, Syria, and Israel before he achieved a decisive victory over
Darius III at the Battle of Gaugamela in 331 BCE.
Continuing to move eastwards, Alexander invaded India in 327 BCE, planning to conquer
the known world and assuming that he was close to this achievement, since the Greeks of his
day were not aware of China’s existence. His war-weary troops, however, rebelled in 326 BCE
and demanded to return home (see Chapter 3). It appears that this mutiny was not the first that
occurred in Alexander’s army; indeed, over the course of his rule, Alexander had also been the
target of a number of failed assassinations. However, this mutiny forced Alexander to give in.
Leaving several of his officers behind as satraps, Alexander turned back. In 323 BCE, he and his
army reached Babylon, the city that he had hoped to make the new capital of his world empire.
There, Alexander fell ill and died at the ripe old age of thirty-three.
While Alexander’s rule only lasted thirteen years, his legacy reshaped Greece and the rest of
ancient Eurasia for the next several centuries. A charismatic leader, albeit one prone to emotional
outbursts, Alexander redefined what it meant to be king and general. His coinage reflects this
reinvention. On one coin minted during his lifetime, for instance, appears Alexander dressed as

the hero Heracles, while Zeus, whom
Alexander alleged to be his real father,
appears on the other side.
In addition, by conquering
territories that were previously not
part of the Greek world, Alexander
spread Greek culture farther than had
anyone else before him. At the same
time, by marrying several non-Greek
princesses and encouraging such
marriages by his troops, Alexander also
encouraged the creation of a “meltingpot” empire; he further cemented this
creation by founding new cities named
after himself all over his new empire. In particular, Alexandria, the city that he founded in Egypt,
became a center of Greek civilization—albeit with an Egyptian twist—was seen as a new Athens
well into the Roman Empire. Alexander’s brief time in India produced a significant impact as well,
as in 321 BCE, Chandragupta Maurya was able to unify India into a single kingdom for the first
time, establishing the Mauryan Empire (see Chapter Three). Finally, in the Middle East, North
Africa, and the Greek world, Alexander’s generals divided his conquests into several kingdoms
that they and their descendants continued to rule until the Romans conquered these respective
areas. It appears that Alexander’s melting-pot empire, burning up as a phoenix upon his death,
actually allowed several new empires and kingdoms to arise from its ashes.
5.11 HELLENISTIC PERIOD
Historians today consider the death of Alexander to be the end point of the Classical Period
and the beginning of the Hellenistic Period. That moment, for historians, also marks the end
of the polis as the main unit of organization in the Greek world. While city-states continued to
exist, the main unit of organization from that point on was the great Hellenistic kingdoms. These
kingdoms, encompassing much greater territory than the Greek world had before Alexander,
contributed to the thorough Hellenization of the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East.
The age of the Hellenistic kingdoms also coincided with the rise of Rome as a military power in the
West. Ultimately, the Hellenistic kingdoms were conquered and absorbed by Rome.
5.11.1 Hellenistic Kingdoms
Although Alexander had several children from his different wives, he did not leave an heir old
enough to take power upon his death. Indeed, his only son, Alexander IV, was only born several
months after his father’s death. Instead, Alexander’s most talented generals turned against each
other in a contest for the control of the empire that they had helped create.

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
These Wars of the Diadochi, as they are known in modern scholarship, ended with a
partition of Alexander’s empire into a number of kingdoms, each ruled by dynasties. Of these,
the four most influential dynasties which retained power for the remainder of the Hellenistic Age,
were the following: Seleucus, who took control of Syria and the surrounding areas, thus creating
the Seleucid Empire; Antigonus Monophthalmos, the One-Eyed, who took over the territory of
Asia Minor and northern Syria, establishing the Antigonid Dynasty; the Attalid Dynasty, which
took power over the Kingdom of Pergamon, after the death of its initial ruler, Lysimachus, a
general of Alexander; and Ptolemy, Alexander’s most influential general, who took control over
Egypt, establishing the Ptolemaic Dynasty.
The most imperialistic of Alexander’s successors, Seleucus I Nicator took Syria, swiftly
expanding his empire to the east to encompass the entire stretch of territory from Syria to India.
At its greatest expanse, this territory’s ethnic diversity was similar to that of Alexander’s original
empire, and Seleucus adopted the same policy of ethnic unity as originally practiced by Alexander;
some of Seleucus’ later successors, however, attempted to impose Hellenization on some of the
peoples under their rule. These successors had difficulties holding on to Seleucus’ conquests. A
notable exception, Antiochus III, attempted to expand the Empire into Anatolia and Greece in
the early second century BCE but was ultimately defeated by the Romans. The empire’s story
for the remainder of its existence is one of almost constant civil wars and increasingly declining
territories. The Seleucids seem to have had a particularly antagonistic relationship with their
Jewish subjects, going so far as to outlaw Judaism in 168 BCE. The Jewish holiday Hannukah
celebrates a miracle that occurred following the historical victory of the Jews, led by Judah

Maccabee, over the Seleucids in 165 BCE. Shortly afterwards, the Seleucids had to allow autonomy
to the Jewish state; it achieved full independence from Seleucid rule in 129 BCE. In 63 BCE, the
Roman general Pompey finally conquered the small remnant of the Seleucid Empire, making it
into the Roman province of Syria.
Antigonus Monophthalmos, Seleucus’ neighbor, whose holdings included Macedonia, Asia
Minor, and the northwestern portion of Syria, harbored ambitious plans that rivaled those of
Seleucus. Antigonus’ hopes of reuniting all of Alexander’s original empire under his own rule,
however, were never realized as Antigonus died in battle in 301 BCE. The greatest threat to the
Antigonids, however, came not from the Seleucid Empire, but from Rome with whom they waged
three Macedonian Wars between 214 and 168 BCE. The Roman defeat of king Perseus in 168 BCE
at the Battle of Pydna marked the end of the Third Macedonian War, and the end of an era, as
control over Greece was now in Roman hands.
The smallest and least imperialistic of the successor states, the kingdom of Pergamon, was
originally part of a very short-lived empire established by Lysimachus, one of Alexander’s generals.
Lysimachus originally held Macedonia and parts of Asia Minor and Thrace but had lost all of these
territories by the time of his death in 281 BCE. One of his officers, Philetaerus, however, took over
the city of Pergamon, establishing there the Attalid dynasty that transformed Pergamon into a
small and successful kingdom. The final Attalid king, Attalus III, left his kingdom to Rome in his
will in 133 BCE.
Lasting from the death of Alexander in 323 BCE to the death of Cleopatra VII in 30 BCE, the
Ptolemaic kingdom proved to be the longest lasting and most successful of the kingdoms carved
from Alexander’s initial empire. Its founder, Ptolemy I Soter, was a talented general, as well as

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
an astronomer, philosopher, and historian, who wrote his own histories of Alexander’s campaigns.
Aiming to make Alexandria the new Athens of the Mediterranean, Ptolemy spared no expense in
building the Museaum, an institution of learning and research that included, most famously, the
Great Library, and worked tirelessly to attract scholars and cultured elite to his city. Subsequent
Ptolemies continued these works so that Alexandria held its reputation as a cultural capital into Late
Antiquity. One example of a particularly impressive scientific discovery is the work of Eratosthenes,
the head librarian at the Great Library in the second half of the third century BCE, who accurately
calculated the earth’s circumference. But while the Ptolemies brought with them Greek language and
culture to Egypt, they were also profoundly influenced by Egyptian customs. Portraying themselves
as the new Pharaohs, the Ptolemies even adopted the Egyptian royal custom of brother-sister
marriages, a practice that eventually percolated down to the general populace as well. Unfortunately,
brother-sister marriages did not prevent strife for power within the royal family. The last of the
Ptolemaic rulers, Cleopatra VII, first married and ruled jointly with her brother Ptolemy XIII. After
defeating him in a civil war, she then married another brother, Ptolemy XIV, remaining his wife
until his death, possibly from sisterly poisoning. Best known for her affairs with Julius Caesar and,
after Caesar’s death, with Marcus Antonius, Cleopatra teamed with Marcus Antonius in a bid for the
Roman Empire. The last surviving ruler who was descended from one of Alexander’s generals, she
was finally defeated by Octavian, the future Roman emperor Augustus, in 30 BCE.
The history of the successor states that resulted from the carving of Alexander’s empire shows
the imperialistic drive of Greek generals, while also demonstrating the instability of their empires.
Historians do not typically engage in counter-factual speculations, but it is very likely that, had
he lived longer, Alexander would have seen his empire unravel, as no structure was really in
place to hold it together. At the same time, the clash of cultures that Alexander’s empire and
the successor states produced resulted in the spread of Greek culture and language further than
ever before; simultaneously, it also introduced the Greeks to other peoples, thus bringing foreign
customs—such as the brother-sister marriages in Egypt—into the lives of the Greeks living outside
the original Greek world.
5.11.2 Hellenistic Culture
The Hellenistic kingdoms spread Greek language, culture, and art all over the areas of
Alexander’s former conquests. Furthermore, many Hellenistic kings, especially the Ptolemies,
were patrons of art and ideas. Thus the Hellenistic era saw the flourishing of art and architecture,
philosophy, medical and scientific writing, and even translations of texts of other civilizations into
Greek. The undisputed center for these advances was Alexandria.
Combining the practical with the ambitious, the Pharos, or Lighthouse, of Alexandria was
one of the most famous examples of Hellenistic architecture and has remained a symbol of the city
to the present day. Constructed in 280 BCE, it was considered to be one of the Seven Wonders of
the Ancient World and was one of the tallest buildings in the world at the time. While its practical
purpose was to guide ships into the harbor at night, it also exemplified the bold advances and
experimental spirit of Hellenistic architecture. Indeed, it was located on a man-made mole off the 
Page | 212
coast of the city. The building comprised three
layers, the top one of which housed the furnace
that produced the light.
The structure of the Pharos shows an
interest in straight lines and orderly shapes,
while its function symbolized the ability of man
to subdue the sea, even by night. Similarly,
both the scientific and medical texts from the
Hellenistic Period reveal a fascination with an
ordered universe and an interest in discovering
how it worked. Herophilus of Chalcedon,
for instance, pioneered dissection in the early
third BCE and was especially interested in the
human brain and the nervous system. The
mathematician Euclid, who lived and worked in
Alexandria during the reign of Ptolemy I (323 –
283 BCE), wrote the Elements, an encyclopedic
work of mathematics that effectively created
the discipline of geometry. Going a step further
than Euclid in his research, the third-century
BCE scientist and inventor Archimedes of
Syracuse specialized in applying mathematical
concepts to create such devices as a screw pump
and a variety of war machines, including the
heat ray.
The same fascination with studying the
order of the universe appears in Hellenistic
philosophy and stems ultimately from the
philosophy of Aristotle (384 – 322 BCE),
considered to be the last Classical Greek
philosopher. Aristotle was a prolific polymath,
who wrote on political theory, poetry, music,
and a variety of sciences, to list just some of his
interests. Engrossed in seeing all disciplines
as part of a larger world order, Aristotle
specifically argued for empiricism, that is, the
belief that knowledge is acquired from sensory
experiences rather than from intuition. In the
sciences, for instance, this approach required
experiments and the careful gathering of data.
While Aristotle’s influence on the Hellenistic

CHAPTER 5: THE GREEK WORLD FROM THE BRONZE AGE TO THE ROMAN CONQUEST
philosophers is undeniable, the alternate theories that some of the philosophers developed
regarding the structure of the universe and the place of humanity in it differs drastically from
Aristotle’s view. For instance, Skepticism, especially as formulated by Pyrrho in the third
century BCE, argued that it was impossible to reach any accurate conclusions about the world
and the key to happiness was to stop trying. Cynic philosophers, starting in the fourth century
BCE, advocated the ascetic life of simplicity and freedom from possessions. A related philosophy,
Stoicism, argued for letting go of all emotions and developing a self-control that would allow one
to live in accordance to nature. On the other hand, the third-century philosophy of Epicureanism
argued for the absence of pain as the ultimate goal in life and saw the universe as ruled by random
chance, separate from the intervention of the gods. All of these philosophies, and many others
that co-existed with them, aimed to provide a coherent system that made sense of the world and
provided a purpose for human life.
Finally, in a testament to the deep influence of the Hellenistic language culture on the conquered
regions, the Hellenistic Period saw the translation of texts of other civilizations into Greek. One
particularly influential example was the translation of the Hebrew Old Testament into Greek. Jews
formed a significant minority of the population of Alexandria, the capital of Ptolemaic Egypt,
as well as other major cities around the Mediterranean, such as Antioch. By the third century
BCE, these Jews appear to have largely lost the knowledge of Hebrew; thus, a translation of the
sacred texts into Greek was necessary. In addition, as later legend has it, Ptolemy II Philadelphus
allegedly commissioned seventy-two scholars to translate the Old Testament into Greek for his
Royal Library. Whether indeed solicited by Ptolemy II or not, the translation was likely completed
over the course of the third throughfirst centuries BCE. Named after the legendary seventy-two
(or, in some versions, seventy) translators, the text was titled the Septuagint. The completion
of this translation showed the thorough Hellenization of even the Jews, who had largely kept
themselves apart from mainstream culture of the cities in which they lived.
5.12 CONCLUSION
“Captive Greece has conquered her rude conqueror,” the Roman poet Horace famously wrote
in the late first century BCE. This comment about the deep influence of Greek culture on the
Roman world, even after the Roman conquest of Greece was complete, continued to be the case
well after the days of Horace. Ultimately, the impact of the Hellenization of the Mediterranean
and the Middle East, which started with Alexander’s conquests, lasted far beyond the Hellenistic
kingdoms, as the Greek language continued to be the language of the Eastern Roman Empire
and, subsequently, the Byzantine Empire up until the conquest of that territory by the Ottomans
in 1453 CE. In some respects, this spread of the Greeks and their civilization ultimately changed
what it meant to be Greek–or, rather, it created a more universal Greek identity, which largely
replaced the polis-specific view of citizenship and identity that existed before Philip’s conquest of
Greece. And yet, certain cultural constants persisted.
The first of these was Homer, whose epics continued to be as great an inspiration to the Greeks
of the Roman world as they were to their Archaic Age counterparts. For instance, the Homeric 
Page | 214
values were likely the reason for the minimal advances in military technology in the Greek world,
as honor was more important than military success at all cost. The second cultural constant was
the work of the philosophers Plato and Aristotle, in whose shadows all subsequent philosophers
of the Greco-Roman world labored. Even as the Greek-speaking portions of the Roman Empire
turned to Christianity, they could not abandon their philosophical roots, resulting, for instance,
in the Gnostic heresies. Horace’s cheeky comment thus proved to be true far longer than he could
have expected.

New Jersey is a state in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern regions of the United States. 
It is bordered on the north and east by the state of New York; on the east, southeast, and south by the Atlantic Ocean; 
on the west by the Delaware River and Pennsylvania; and on the southwest by Delaware Bay and the state of Delaware. 
At 7,354 square miles (19,050 km2), New Jersey is the fifth-smallest state based on land area, but with close to 9.3 million 
residents,[6] is the 11th-most populous and the most densely populated. New Jersey's state capital is Trenton, 
while the state's most populous city is Newark. With the sole exception of Warren County,[10] all counties 
in the state lie within the combined statistical areas of New York City or Philadelphia; consequently, 
the state's largest metropolitan area falls within Greater New York.

New Jersey was first inhabited by Native Americans for at least 2,800 years, with the Lenape being the dominant group 
when Europeans arrived in the early 17th century. Dutch and Swedish colonists founded the first European settlements 
in the state.[11] The English later seized control of the region and established the Province of New Jersey, after 
the largest of the Channel Islands, Jersey.[12][13] The colony's fertile lands and relative religious tolerance drew 
a large and diverse population. New Jersey was among the Thirteen Colonies that opposed Great Britain, hosting numerous 
pivotal battles and military commands in the American Revolutionary War. The state remained in the Union during 
the American Civil War, and thereafter became a major center of manufacturing and immigration; it helped drive 
the nation's Industrial Revolution,[14] and became the site of numerous technological and commercial innovations 
into the mid 20th century.

New Jersey's central location in the Northeast megalopolis fueled its rapid growth and suburbanization in the second 
half of the 20th century. At the turn of the 21st century, its economy increasingly diversified, with major sectors 
including biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, specialized agriculture, and informational technology. New Jersey remains 
a major destination for immigrants, with one of the most multicultural populations in the U.S.[15][16] Echoing historic 
trends, the state has increasingly re-urbanized, with growth in the cities outpacing the suburbs since 2008.[17] 
New Jersey is one of the wealthiest states in the U.S., with the second highest median household income in 2017.[18] 
Almost one-tenth of all households, or over 323,000 of 3.3 million, are millionaires, the highest rate per capita 
in the country.[19] New Jersey's public school system consistently ranks at or among the top of all U.S. states.
