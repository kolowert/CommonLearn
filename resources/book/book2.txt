Dancing in the moonlight

we get it on most every night 
when that moon is big and bright 
it's a supernatural delight 
everybody's dancing in the moonlight 

everybody here is out of sight 
they don't bark and they don't bite 
they keep things loose they keep it tight 
everybody's dancing in the moonlight 

dancing in the moonlight 
everybody's feeling warm and bright 
it's such a fine and natural sight 
everybody's dancing in the moonlight 

we like our fun and we never fight 
you can't dance and stay uptight 
it's a supernatural delight 
everybody was dancing in the moonlight 

dancing in the moonlight 
everybody's feeling warm and bright 
it's such a fine and natural sight 
everybody's dancing in the moonlight 

we get in on most every night 
and when that moon is big and bright 
it's a supernatural delight 
everybody's dancing in the moonlight 

dancing in the moonlight 
everybody's feeling warm and bright 
it's such a fine and natural sight 
everybody's dancing in the moonlight
